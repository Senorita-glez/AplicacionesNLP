adele,Looking for some education
adele,Made my way into the night
adele,All that bullshit conversation
adele,"Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby"
adele,I don't even wanna waste your time
adele,Let's just say that maybe
adele,You could help me ease my mind
adele,I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
adele,If that's love in your eyes
adele,It's more than enough
adele,Had some bad love
adele,"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
adele,"Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation"
adele,Made my way into the sun
adele,My friends got their ladies
adele,And they're all having babies
adele,"I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby"
adele,I don't even wanna waste your time
adele,Let's just say that maybe
adele,You could help me ease my mind
adele,I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
adele,If that's love in your eyes
adele,It's more than enough
adele,I've had some bad love
adele,"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
adele,"Baby, baby"
adele,"Ooh, ooh"
adele,"Baby, baby"
adele,"Ooh, ooh"
adele,"Baby, baby"
adele,Ooh In the absence of security
adele,I made my way into the night
adele,Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
adele,And I see nothing in his eyes
adele,I miss my baby
adele,"Oh I, I miss my baby"
adele,I miss my baby
adele,"I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby"

adele,That you found a girl and you're married now
adele,I heard that your dreams came true
adele,"Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?"
adele,"Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
adele,"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
adele,I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
adele,"That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
adele,I wish nothing but the best for you two
adele,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
adele,"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
adele,"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies"
adele,Only yesterday was the time of our lives
adele,We were born and raised in a summer haze
adele,"Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
adele,"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
adele,I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
adele,"That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
adele,I wish nothing but the best for you two
adele,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
adele,"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares"
adele,"Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made"
adele,"Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
adele,I wish nothing but the best for you
adele,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
adele,"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you"

adele,"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart"
adele,"Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark"

adele,You played it
adele,"You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me"
adele,I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
adele,To go over everything
adele,They say that time's supposed to heal ya
adele,"But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?"
adele,I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
adele,When we were younger and free
adele,I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
adele,And a million miles Hello from the other side
adele,I must've called a thousand times
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For everything that I've done
adele,But when I call you never
adele,Seem to be home Hello from the outside
adele,At least I can say that I've tried
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For breaking your heart
adele,"But it don't matter, it clearly"
adele,"Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?"
adele,"It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry"
adele,I hope that you're well
adele,Did you ever make it out of that town
adele,Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
adele,That the both of us
adele,Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
adele,I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For everything that I've done
adele,But when I call you never
adele,Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
adele,At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For breaking your heart
adele,"But it don't matter, it clearly"
adele,"Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore"
adele,"Oh, anymore"
adele,"Oh, anymore"
adele,Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
adele,I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For everything that I've done
adele,But when I call you never
adele,Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
adele,At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For breaking your heart
adele,"But it don't matter, it clearly"
adele,Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
adele,I won't say a word
adele,They've all been said before you know
adele,So why don't we just play pretend
adele,Like we're not scared of what's coming next
adele,"Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong"
adele,I know there is no tomorrow
adele,All I ask is If this is my last night with you
adele,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
adele,Give me a memory I can use
adele,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
adele,It matters how this ends
adele,'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
adele,It's already in your eyes
adele,"And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me"
adele,No one knows me like you do
adele,And since you're the only one that matters
adele,"Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong"
adele,I know there is no tomorrow
adele,All I ask is If this is my last night with you
adele,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
adele,Give me a memory I can use
adele,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
adele,It matters how this ends
adele,'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
adele,Let this be the way we remember us
adele,I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
adele,And I ain't asking for forgiveness
adele,All I ask is If this is my last night with you
adele,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
adele,Give me a memory I can use
adele,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
adele,It matters how this ends
adele,"'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,"
adele,And as it fell you rose to claim it
adele,It was dark and I was over
adele,"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
adele,But my knees were far too weak
adele,To stand in your arms
adele,"Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew"
adele,"All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true"
adele,"And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,Let it burn while I cry
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you"
adele,"I could stay there, close my eyes"
adele,"Feel you here, forever"
adele,"You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew"
adele,"All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true"
adele,"And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,Let it burn while I cried
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain"
adele,And I threw us into the flames
adele,"Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that"
adele,"That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door"
adele,As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
adele,Even now when it's already over
adele,I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,Let it burn while I cried
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain"
adele,And I threw us into the flames
adele,Where I felt something die
adele,"'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh"
adele,"Oh, oh Let it burn, oh"
adele,Let it burn
adele,Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
adele,From the way you talk
adele,To the way you move
adele,Everybody here is watching you
adele,'Cause you feel like home
adele,You're like a dream come true
adele,But if by chance you're here alone
adele,Can I have a moment
adele,Before I go?
adele,'Cause I've been by myself all night long
adele,Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
adele,You sound like a song
adele,"My God, this reminds me"
adele,Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
adele,In case it is the last time
adele,That we might be exactly like we were
adele,Before we realized
adele,We were sad of getting old
adele,It made us restless
adele,It was just like a movie
adele,It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
adele,Nobody told me that you'd be here
adele,And I swore you moved overseas
adele,"That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie"
adele,You still sound like a song
adele,"My God, this reminds me"
adele,Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
adele,In case it is the last time
adele,That we might be exactly like we were
adele,Before we realized
adele,We were sad of getting old
adele,It made us restless
adele,It was just like a movie
adele,It was just like a song When we were young
adele,When we were young
adele,When we were young
adele,When we were young It's hard to win me back
adele,Everything just takes me back
adele,To when you were there
adele,To when you were there
adele,And a part of me keeps holding on
adele,Just in case it hasn't gone
adele,I guess I still care
adele,Do you still care? It was just like a movie
adele,It was just like a song
adele,"My God, this reminds me"
adele,Of when we were young When we were young
adele,When we were young
adele,When we were young
adele,When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
adele,In case it is the last time
adele,That we might be exactly like we were
adele,Before we realized
adele,We were sad of getting old
adele,It made us restless
adele,"Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old"
adele,It makes me reckless
adele,It was just like a movie
adele,It was just like a song
adele,When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am home again
adele,Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am young again
adele,Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
adele,However long I stay I will always love you
adele,Whatever words I say I will always love you
adele,I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am free again
adele,Whenever I'm alone with you

adele,I will always love you
adele,I will always love you
adele,'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
adele,And the whole world is on your case
adele,I could offer you a warm embrace
adele,To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
adele,And there is no one there to dry your tears
adele,I could hold you for a million years
adele,To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
adele,But I would never do you wrong
adele,I've known it from the moment that we met
adele,"no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue"
adele,I'd go crawling down the avenue
adele,"No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do"
adele,To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
adele,And on the highway of regret
adele,The winds of change are blowing wild and free
adele,"You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true"
adele,Nothing that I wouldn't do
adele,Go to the ends of the Earth for you
adele,To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
adele,Don't need to think it over
adele,If I'm wrong I am right
adele,Don't need to look no further
adele,This ain't lust
adele,I know this is love but If I tell the world
adele,I'll never say enough
adele,Cause it was not said to you
adele,And that's exactly what I need to do
adele,If I'm in love with you Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere
adele,Or would it be a waste?
adele,Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
adele,Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
adele,And fly around in circles
adele,Waiting as my heart drops
adele,And my back begins to tingle
adele,Finally could this be it or Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere
adele,Or would it be a waste?
adele,Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
adele,Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,"Even if, it leads nowhere"

adele,Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
adele,Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere
adele,Or would it be a waste?
adele,Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
adele,Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
adele,"You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said"
adele,No final kiss to seal anything
adele,I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
adele,"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
adele,"But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,"The reason you loved me before,"
adele,Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
adele,Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
adele,I often think about where I went wrong
adele,"The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness"
adele,"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
adele,"But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,The reason you loved me before
adele,"Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe"
adele,I kept my distance so you would be free
adele,In hope that you find the missing piece
adele,"To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,The reason you loved me before
adele,Baby please remember me once more
adele,"When will I see you again? She, she ain't real"
adele,She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
adele,She is a stranger
adele,You and I have history
adele,Or don't you remember
adele,"Sure, she's got it all"
adele,"But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds"
adele,You made a fool out of you
adele,"And, boy, she's bringing you down"

adele,Like when we creep out and she ain't around
adele,"Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds"

adele,When I was young
adele,Deep down I must have always known
adele,That this would be inevitable
adele,To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
adele,And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
adele,Who regrets the things they've done
adele,Sometimes I just feel it's only me
adele,Who can't stand the reflection that they see
adele,I wish I could live a little more
adele,"Look up to the sky, not just the floor"
adele,I feel like my life is flashing by
adele,And all I can do is watch and cry
adele,"I miss the air, I miss my friends"
adele,"I miss my mother, I miss it when"
adele,Life was a party to be thrown
adele,But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
adele,Where I grew up and found my feet
adele,They can't look me in the eye
adele,It's like they're scared of me
adele,I try to think of things to say
adele,Like a joke or a memory
adele,But they don't recognize me now
adele,In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
adele,Who regrets the things they've done
adele,Sometimes I just feel it's only me
adele,Who never became who they thought they'd be
adele,I wish I could live a little more
adele,"Look up to the sky, not just the floor"

adele,"I miss my mother, I miss it when"
adele,Life was a party to be thrown
adele,But that was a million years ago
adele,A million years ago Looking for some education
adele,Made my way into the night
adele,All that bullshit conversation
adele,"Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby"
adele,I don't even wanna waste your time
adele,Let's just say that maybe
adele,You could help me ease my mind
adele,I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
adele,If that's love in your eyes
adele,It's more than enough
adele,Had some bad love
adele,"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
adele,"Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation"
adele,Made my way into the sun
adele,My friends got their ladies

adele,I miss my baby
adele,"Oh I, I miss my baby"
adele,I miss my baby
adele,"I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby"
adele,"Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave"

adele,The scars of your love remind me of us
adele,They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
adele,"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
adele,"I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)"
adele,Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
adele,You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
adele,And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
adele,Baby I have no story to be told
adele,But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
adele,Think of me in the depths of your despair

adele,But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
adele,Throw your stone through every open door
adele,Count your blessings to find what you look for
adele,Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
adele,You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)

adele,"But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,"
adele,"They don't know you like I do,"
adele,Or at least as far as I thought I knew
adele,"I can't bear this time,"
adele,"It drags, as I lose my mind"
adele,Reminded by things I find
adele,I know some clothes you left behind.
adele,"Wake me up, wake me up when all is done"
adele,I won't rise until this battle's won
adele,My dignity is become undone But I won't go
adele,I can't do it on my own
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,I'm willing to take the risk
adele,"I won't go, I can't do it on my own,"
adele,"If this is ain't love, then what is?"
adele,"I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,"
adele,What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
adele,I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
adele,I heard his voice today
adele,I didn't know a single word he said
adele,Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
adele,"Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,I'm willing to take the risk
adele,"I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,"I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up"
adele,"Bursting at the seams, no doubt"
adele,We almost fall apart and burn up easy
adele,So watch them turn to dust
adele,"But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,I'm willing to take the risk
adele,"I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,"I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?"
adele,Will he still love me even when he's free
adele,Or will he go back to the place where
adele,He will choose the poison over me?
adele,When we spoke yesterday
adele,"He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait"
adele,"I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go"
adele,He can't do it on his own
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,He's willing to take the risk
adele,"So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,"
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
adele,He can't do it on his own
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,We're willing to take the risk
adele,I won't go! I can't do it on my own
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,"I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,"
adele,And as it fell you rose to claim it
adele,It was dark and I was over
adele,"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
adele,But my knees were far too weak
adele,To stand in your arms
adele,Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
adele,"That I never knew, never knew"
adele,All the things you'd say
adele,"They were never true, never true"
adele,And the games you play
adele,"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,"Well, it burned while I cried"
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
adele,Your name When I lay with you
adele,I could stay there
adele,Close my eyes
adele,Feel you here forever
adele,You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
adele,"That I never knew, never knew"
adele,All the things you'd say
adele,"They were never true, never true"
adele,And the games you play
adele,"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,"Well, it burned while I cried"
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,"
adele,Your name I set fire to the rain
adele,And I threw us into the flames
adele,"Well, it felt something died"
adele,'Cause I knew that that was
adele,"The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,"
adele,That heart you caught must be waiting for you
adele,Even now when we're already over
adele,I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,"Well, it burned while I cried"
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
adele,"Your name I set fire to the rain,"
adele,And I threw us into the flames

adele,"When did it go wrong, I will never know"
adele,I have loved you all my life
adele,"How did it slow down, I go round and round"
adele,Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
adele,I gave you heaven on a platter baby
adele,I gave you everything you never gave me
adele,I never lied and I never faked it
adele,Only wanted for you to save me
adele,"This love, it ain't over yet"
adele,There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
adele,Did you find the note that I wrote?
adele,I hid it in the seam of your coat
adele,"It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat"
adele,Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
adele,"Why were you so cold, let the truth be told"
adele,Tell me was it all for the thrill?
adele,"What was I thinking, I gave you everything"
adele,But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
adele,I gave you heaven on a platter baby
adele,I gave you everything you never gave me
adele,I never lied and I never faked it
adele,Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
adele,Did you find the note that I wrote?
adele,I hid it in the seam of your coat
adele,"It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat"
adele,Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
adele,Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
adele,Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
adele,Did you find the note that I wrote?
adele,I hid it in the seam of your coat
adele,"It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat"
adele,Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
adele,"Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon"
adele,"Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true."
adele,"I fall short each time,"
adele,Every time he ain't here
adele,You and your charm creep closer
adele,Closer and near
adele,"Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all."
adele,"Like a bomb before explosion,"
adele,"Ticking by your call,"
adele,"You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,"
adele,"And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,"
adele,"Than I ever did you before,"
adele,"So stand beside the river I cried,"
adele,And lay yourself down.
adele,"Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees"
adele,At the first sight of you crawling back to me
adele,"To whisper ""will you leave your man? """
adele,Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
adele,"I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,"
adele,"Than I ever did you before,"
adele,So stand beside the river I cried
adele,And lay yourself down.
adele,"Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,"
adele,You must be mistaken
adele,"I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong"
adele,"And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,"
adele,Than you ever did me before.
adele,So stand beside the river you cried
adele,And lay yourself down!
adele,"Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,"
adele,"You said I'm crazy,"
adele,If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
adele,"Turns me crazy,"
adele,But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
adele,You drift into my head
adele,"And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,"
adele,"If you want me to stop I'll freeze,"
adele,"And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,"
adele,And make me crazy for you.
adele,Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
adele,"I wish you'd come over,"
adele,"Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,"
adele,Strips me down bare
adele,"And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,"
adele,"But the more I do,"
adele,"The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,"
adele,Hoping you'll walk through
adele,"And save me boy,"
adele,Because I'm too crazy for you.
adele,Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
adele,And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
adele,"But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made"
adele,I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
adele,Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
adele,"But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough"
adele,When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
adele,"There was something in the water, now that something's in me"
adele,"Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
adele,"I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
adele,"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
adele,It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
adele,"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
adele,"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late"
adele,That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
adele,"Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance"
adele,But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
adele,"No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
adele,"I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
adele,"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins"
adele,"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
adele,"Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
adele,"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham"
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
adele,Without one dollar to my name
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in"
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,Nobody knows it better than me
adele,I wouldn't be wishing I was free
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will"
adele,At least I know he's lying still
adele,Four cold walls without parole
adele,Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
adele,At least I know he's lying still
adele,Four cold walls without parole
adele,Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
adele,Put myself behind a jailhouse door
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love"
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes"
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down"
adele,It had only just begun but now it's over now
adele,And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
adele,I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
adele,On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
adele,The night
adele,When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
adele,Your teasing ain't enough
adele,Fed up of biding your time
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,"And for what, and for what, and for what"
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,"Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind"
adele,I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
adele,A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
adele,I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
adele,Your teasing ain't enough
adele,Fed up of biding your time
adele,When I don't get nothing back

adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,"Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain"
adele,It's better when something is wrong
adele,You get excitement in your bones
adele,And everything you do's a game
adele,When night comes and you're on your own
adele,You can say I chose to be alone
adele,Who wants to be right as rain
adele,It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off

adele,"Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired"
adele,I need to get away to feel again
adele,"Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind"
adele,"Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself"
adele,"Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind"
adele,And if I stay I'll be alive
adele,Then choke on words I'd always hide
adele,"Excuse me first love, but we're through"
adele,"I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired"

adele,We will stand tall
adele,Face it all together Let the skyfall
adele,When it crumbles
adele,We will stand tall
adele,Face it all together
adele,At skyfall
adele,At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
adele,A thousand miles and poles apart
adele,Where worlds collide and days are dark
adele,"You may have my number, you can take my name"
adele,But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)

adele,At skyfall This is how the story went
adele,I met someone by accident
adele,It blew me away
adele,Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
adele,When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
adele,"And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you"
adele,When the day is done
adele,And wake up to your face against the morning sun
adele,But like everything I've ever known
adele,You disappear one day
adele,So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
adele,Put a kiss on top of your head
adele,Watch you wave
adele,And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
adele,And neon lights and waiting papers
adele,That I call home
adele,I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
adele,When the day is done
adele,And wake up to your face against the morning sun
adele,But like everything I've ever known
adele,You disappear one day
adele,"So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted"
adele,I'm going back to where I started
adele,"The morning rain, the morning rain"
adele,And though I wish that you were here
adele,On that same old road that brought me here
adele,"It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you"
adele,When the day is done
adele,And wake up to your face against the morning sun
adele,But like everything I've ever known
adele,You disappear one day
adele,So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
adele,I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
adele,Pulls me down turns me weak for you
adele,I find myself repeating like a broken tune
adele,And I'm forever excusing your intentions
adele,That I give in to my pretendings
adele,Which forgive you each time
adele,Without me knowing
adele,They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
adele,You say my name like there could be an us
adele,I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
adele,I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
adele,I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
adele,So desperately I try to link it with my head
adele,But instead I fall back to my knees
adele,As you tear your way right through me
adele,I forgive you once again
adele,Without me knowing
adele,You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
adele,You say my name like there could be an us
adele,I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
adele,I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
adele,Whenever I'm standing my own ground
adele,"You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up"
adele,I say your name like there should be an us
adele,"I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love"
adele,I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
adele,And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
adele,And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
adele,And thinking you would listen to all of the things
adele,The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
adele,So darling
adele,Darling
adele,Darling this is goodbye Oh
adele,I still care
adele,Fool that I am
adele,Ooh
adele,I still care
adele,Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
adele,And the things I think just don't make sense
adele,So where you been then? Don't go all coy
adele,Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
adele,See I can see that look in your eyes
adele,The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,You shower me with words made of knives
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
adele,You make it look like I'm see-through
adele,Do tell me why you waste our time
adele,"When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied"
adele,You know I know just how you feel
adele,I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,You shower me with words made of knives
adele,"Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool"
adele,(Just for you)
adele,Even in the daylight when you think that
adele,(I don't see you)
adele,Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
adele,Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,You shower me with words made of knives
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,You shower me with words made of knives
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]

adele,I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
adele,Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
adele,And I'm all you need and that you never want more
adele,Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
adele,But you'd save the best for last
adele,Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
adele,This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
adele,Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
adele,How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
adele,It turns out it ain't enough
adele,You're still not mentioning love
adele,What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
adele,I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
adele,And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
adele,And I think that I know things may never change
adele,I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
adele,And I'm all you need and that you never want more
adele,Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue

adele,"How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know"
adele,I find it hard to let go and give up on you
adele,Seems I love the things you do
adele,Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
adele,To persist with this heartbreak and running around
adele,And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
adele,And be all you need so that you never want more
adele,And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
adele,"And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,"
adele,And as it fell you rose to claim it
adele,It was dark and I was over
adele,"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
adele,But my knees were far too weak
adele,To stand in your arms
adele,Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
adele,"That I never knew, never knew"
adele,All the things you'd say
adele,"They were never true, never true"

adele,You've turned out to be the only face I see!
adele,Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
adele,You spin a web in every room
adele,And try to break the backbone that I've grown
adele,Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
adele,Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
adele,Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
adele,To say goodnight
adele,I'd always kiss
adele,And hold you tight
adele,But lately
adele,You don't seem
adele,To care
adele,You close the door
adele,And leave me
adele,Standing there

adele,Their lipstick
adele,On your face
adele,"Oh, they smeared it"
adele,Every place
adele,Ye that's it honey

adele,I love your precious heart I was standing
adele,You were there
adele,Two worlds collided
adele,And they could never tear us apart We could live
adele,For a thousand years
adele,But if I hurt you
adele,I'd make wine from your tears I told you
adele,That we could fly
adele,'Cause we all have wings
adele,But some of us don't know why I
adele,I was standing
adele,You were there
adele,Two worlds collided
adele,And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
adele,But how will you ever know if you never try
adele,There's something new inside my heart
adele,And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
adele,I see your face under every sky
adele,"I find the less I look, more I find"
adele,"So let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,You're the only one I want
adele,"Let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
adele,But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
adele,You said my name in the dead of glory
adele,You hold me alright
adele,"When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star"

adele,When we'll try to give it up

adele,And we'll watch them turn to dust
adele,"But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you

adele,"Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door"
adele,See if I cry
adele,See if I shed a single sorry tear
adele,Can't say that it's been that great
adele,No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
adele,Everybody sees
adele,And everyone agrees
adele,That you and I are wrong
adele,And it's been that way to long
adele,Take it as it comes
adele,And be thankful when it's done
adele,There's so many ways to act
adele,And there's many shades of black
adele,"There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out"

adele,Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
adele,Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
adele,"My heart so bad, it cuts through"
adele,The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
adele,"Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait"
adele,To make us grow from dust

adele,So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
adele,With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
adele,But as time goes on and my age gets older
adele,"I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait"
adele,To make us grow from dust
adele,Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
adele,So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
adele,To make us grow from dust
adele,Then our eyes cry and souls sigh

blink-182,"What's my age again, what's my age again? That's about the time she broke up with me"
blink-182,No one should take themselves so seriously
blink-182,With many years ahead to fall in line
blink-182,Why would you wish that on me?
blink-182,I never want to act my age
blink-182,"What's my age again, what's my age again? What's my age again? All the small things"
blink-182,True care truth brings
blink-182,I'll take one lift
blink-182,Your ride best trip

blink-182,"I wunna suck my dad, and my mom too, oh is this thing on? (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare"
blink-182,The shadow in the background of the morgue
blink-182,The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
blink-182,We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
blink-182,Where you can always find me
blink-182,And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
blink-182,And in the night we'll wish this never ends
blink-182,We'll wish this never ends (I miss you I miss you)
blink-182,(I miss you I miss you) Where are you and I'm so sorry
blink-182,I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
blink-182,I need somebody and always
blink-182,This sick strange darkness
blink-182,Comes creeping on so haunting every time
blink-182,And as I stared I counted
blink-182,The Webs from all the spiders
blink-182,Catching things and eating their insides
blink-182,Like indecision to call you
blink-182,And hear your voice of treason
blink-182,Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
blink-182,Stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me you're already
blink-182,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
blink-182,Don't waste your time on me you're already
blink-182,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already

blink-182,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
blink-182,Don't waste your time on me you're already
blink-182,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)
blink-182,(I miss you miss you) It's alright to tell me what you think about me
blink-182,I won't try to argue or hold it against you
blink-182,"I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons"
blink-182,"The season is calling, your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face"
blink-182,The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
blink-182,A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
blink-182,On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again
blink-182,I'll turn to a friend
blink-182,Someone that understands
blink-182,Sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
blink-182,And I've been here for too long
blink-182,"To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,Well I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
blink-182,You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
blink-182,"And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay"
blink-182,"The charade, it won't last, when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again"
blink-182,You'll turn to a friend
blink-182,Someone that understands
blink-182,And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
blink-182,And you've been there for too long
blink-182,"To face this on your own, well I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,"Well, I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,"Well, I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,"Well, I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,"Well, I guess this is growing up I never thought I'd die alone"
blink-182,I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
blink-182,I trace the cord back to the wall
blink-182,No wonder it was never plugged in at all
blink-182,"I took my time, I hurried up"
blink-182,The choice was mine I didn't think enough
blink-182,I'm too depressed to go on
blink-182,"You'll be sorry when I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came"
blink-182,Sixteen just held such better days
blink-182,Days when I still felt alive
blink-182,We couldn't wait to get outside
blink-182,"The world was wide, too late to try"
blink-182,"The tour was over, we'd survived"
blink-182,I couldn't wait till I got home
blink-182,To pass the time in my room alone I never thought I'd die alone
blink-182,Another six months I'll be unknown
blink-182,Give all my things to all my friends
blink-182,You'll never step foot in my room again
blink-182,"You'll close it off, board it up"
blink-182,Remember the time that I spilled the cup
blink-182,Of apple juice in the hall
blink-182,"Please tell mom this is not her fault I never conquered, when you came"
blink-182,Sixteen just held such better days
blink-182,Days when I still felt alive
blink-182,We couldn't wait to get outside
blink-182,"The world was wide, too late to try"
blink-182,"The tour was over, we'd survived"
blink-182,I couldn't wait till I got home
blink-182,"To pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, when you came"
blink-182,Tomorrow holds such better days
blink-182,Days when I can still feel alive
blink-182,When I can't wait to get outside
blink-182,"The world is wide, the time goes by"
blink-182,"The tour is over, I've survived"
blink-182,I can't wait till I get home
blink-182,To pass the time in my room alone In the car I just can't wait
blink-182,To pick you up on our very first date
blink-182,Is it cool if I hold your hand?
blink-182,Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
blink-182,Do you like my stupid hair?
blink-182,Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
blink-182,I'm just scared of what you think
blink-182,You make me nervous so I really can't eat Let's go

blink-182,I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
blink-182,I really wish it was only me and you
blink-182,I'm jealous of everybody in the room
blink-182,Please don't look at me with those eyes
blink-182,Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
blink-182,I dread the thought of our very first kiss
blink-182,A target that I'm probably gonna miss Let's go

blink-182,On the first night we met Look to the past
blink-182,And remember her smile

blink-182,When the shades have been pulled shut
blink-182,This house is haunted
blink-182,It's so pathetic
blink-182,It makes no sense at all
blink-182,I'm ripe with things to say
blink-182,The words rot and fall away
blink-182,What stupid poem could fix this home
blink-182,I'd read it every day So here's your holiday
blink-182,Hope you enjoy it this time

blink-182,Twenty years now lost
blink-182,It's not right Their anger hurts my ears
blink-182,Been running strong for seven years
blink-182,Rather than fix the problems
blink-182,They never solve them
blink-182,It makes no sense at all
blink-182,I see them everyday
blink-182,"We get along, so why can't they?"
blink-182,If this is what he wants
blink-182,And this is what she wants

blink-182,I kinda like the little rush you get
blink-182,When you're standing close to death
blink-182,Like when you're driving me crazy Hold on as we crash into the earth
blink-182,A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
blink-182,"For real 'cause you were driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery"
blink-182,"Do you grin inside, you're killing me"
blink-182,All along we talked of forever
blink-182,I kinda think that we won't get better
blink-182,"It's the longest start, but the end is not too far away"
blink-182,"Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight"
blink-182,Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
blink-182,We'll fall apart on the weekend

blink-182,All I hear are the many echoes of
blink-182,The darkest words you said
blink-182,And it's driving me crazy I can't find the best in all of this
blink-182,But I'm always looking out for you
blink-182,'Cause you're the one I miss

blink-182,I barely made it out alive
blink-182,"I'm not bent, I'm not cracked"
blink-182,I'm just broken
blink-182,I watched the fire burn the sea
blink-182,I wrapped my car around a tree
blink-182,"Hold me up, underneath"
blink-182,This heavy burden There's a halo in the distance
blink-182,Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,Up in smoke with the fire we started
blink-182,Misery loves company
blink-182,I don't need anyone
blink-182,Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
blink-182,Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
blink-182,Misery loves company
blink-182,I don't need anyone Tied up to a heart of stone
blink-182,I screamed into a microphone
blink-182,"I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep"
blink-182,Misery loves company
blink-182,"When I'm bent, when I'm cracked"

blink-182,"I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down"
blink-182,In the dark awake and you're not around
blink-182,And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
blink-182,Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
blink-182,And I won't be there and you're all alone
blink-182,'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
blink-182,Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
blink-182,In an empty bed with an hour to kill
blink-182,'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,Up in smoke with the fire we started

blink-182,I don't need anyone
blink-182,I don't need anyone There's an echo pulling out the meaning
blink-182,Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
blink-182,The voices in my head are always screaming
blink-182,That none of this means anything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
blink-182,The whispers turn into a scream
blink-182,"And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly"
blink-182,Bored to death and fading fast
blink-182,Life is too short to last long
blink-182,"Back on earth, I'm broken"
blink-182,Lost and cold and fading fast
blink-182,Life is too short to last long There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
blink-182,Rescuing a tiger from a tree
blink-182,The pictures in her head are always dreaming
blink-182,Each of them means everything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
blink-182,The whispers turn into a scream
blink-182,"And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly"
blink-182,Bored to death and fading fast

blink-182,Life is too short to last long Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
blink-182,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh) I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh) I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh) but all my friends are daring me to come over

blink-182,And I keep pushing you away
blink-182,Don't wait for me
blink-182,Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
blink-182,Home is such a lonely place I love the lightning but hate the rain
blink-182,Tomorrow's frightening but not today
blink-182,Wish I could slow down time
blink-182,But not enough to slow you down I feel like the moon
blink-182,Is spinning off into outer space without you
blink-182,The universe an empty place without you I wish that we could save today
blink-182,But I know we can't stay the same
blink-182,And I keep pushing you away

blink-182,Home is such a lonely place We're falling faster than we can fly
blink-182,Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive I wish that we could save today

blink-182,And I keep pushing you away
blink-182,Don't wait for me

blink-182,Remember I'm a kid
blink-182,I know not what I did
blink-182,Just having fun You couldn't wait for something new
blink-182,And yesterday I thought of you
blink-182,It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
blink-182,"It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose"
blink-182,A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
blink-182,Nothing to do
blink-182,"They can't trust me because I blew it once before Shit, dad"
blink-182,Please don't kick my ass
blink-182,I know I've seen you trashed
blink-182,At least one time Can I blame it
blink-182,On one of my dumb friends
blink-182,It's been awhile
blink-182,Since I have used that line You couldn't wait for something new
blink-182,And yesterday I thought of you
blink-182,It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away

blink-182,A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
blink-182,Nothing to do
blink-182,They can't trust me because I blew it once before Beige little boxes in a row
blink-182,Neighbors and friends that you don't know
blink-182,"Here's a form, go wait in line"
blink-182,"Can't you see I'm doing fine, it's what I've always wanted Two little kids out on the lawn"
blink-182,"Once we had love, now it's gone"
blink-182,Good things haven't happened yet
blink-182,"I'm empty as a movie set, it's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California"
blink-182,Beautiful haze of suburbia
blink-182,Living in the perfect weather
blink-182,Spending time inside together
blink-182,"Hey, here's to you California Wearing all black out on the beach"
blink-182,Faces I've seen in magazines
blink-182,Let's take a walk out on the pier
blink-182,"Watch the shoreline disappear, iIt's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California"

blink-182,Hear your voice in the dark
blink-182,Lose myself in your eyes
blink-182,Choke my voice Say goodnight
blink-182,As the world falls apart
blink-182,"Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go"
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this Here's a letter for you
blink-182,But the words get confused
blink-182,And the conversation dies
blink-182,Apologize for the past
blink-182,Talk some shit take it back
blink-182,"Are we cursed to this life Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go"
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this problem

blink-182,My life just lost all meaning
blink-182,Do one thing for me tonight
blink-182,I'm dying in this silence The last star left in heaven
blink-182,Is falling down to earth and
blink-182,Do you still feel the same way
blink-182,"Do you still feel the same way Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go"
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this problem
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this problem
blink-182,"I need some more time to fix this So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over"
blink-182,There's so much more that I wanted and
blink-182,(So sorry it's over)
blink-182,There's so much more that I needed and
blink-182,(So sorry it's over)
blink-182,Time keeps moving on and on and on
blink-182,Soon we'll all be gone
blink-182,Let's take some time to talk this over
blink-182,You're out of line and rarely sober
blink-182,We can't depend on your excuses
blink-182,'Cause in the end it's fuckin' useless
blink-182,You can only lean on me for so long
blink-182,Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
blink-182,"Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down"
blink-182,You can only lean on me for so long I remember shots without a chaser
blink-182,"Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger"
blink-182,Cover up the scars put on your gameface
blink-182,Left you in the bar to try and save face You can only lean on me for so long
blink-182,Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
blink-182,"Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down"
blink-182,You can only lean on me for so long
blink-182,"So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over"
blink-182,There's so much more that I wanted and
blink-182,(So sorry it's over)
blink-182,There's so much more that I needed and
blink-182,(So sorry it's over)
blink-182,Time keeps moving on and on and on
blink-182,"Soon we'll all be gone Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around"
blink-182,"Insider information, hand in your resignation"
blink-182,Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
blink-182,Tight lipped procrastination
blink-182,"Yeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers)"
blink-182,Do you want to come to a party
blink-182,My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
blink-182,This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
blink-182,Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
blink-182,Would be someone there who would catch my attention
blink-182,I wasn't out searching for love or affection
blink-182,So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
blink-182,Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
blink-182,Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
blink-182,This place is so lame all these girls look the same
blink-182,All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
blink-182,In my bed back at home watching TV alone
blink-182,Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
blink-182,Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
blink-182,Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there
blink-182,With green eyes and long blond hair
blink-182,She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
blink-182,She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
blink-182,Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
blink-182,But that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
blink-182,Some girls try too hard to impress
blink-182,With the way that they dress
blink-182,With those things on their chests
blink-182,And the things they suggest to me I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
blink-182,The names she was dropping the games she was playing
blink-182,She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
blink-182,How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
blink-182,Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
blink-182,Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
blink-182,So I said I'd call her but never would bother
blink-182,Until I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there
blink-182,With green eyes and long blonde hair
blink-182,She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
blink-182,This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
blink-182,You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
blink-182,Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
blink-182,Some girls try too hard to impress
blink-182,With the way that they dress
blink-182,With those things on their chest
blink-182,And the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard
blink-182,Some girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again
blink-182,The one where I wake up and I'm alive
blink-182,Just as the four walls close me within
blink-182,My eyes are open up with pure sunlight
blink-182,I'm the first to know
blink-182,My dearest friends
blink-182,Even if your hope has burned with time
blink-182,Anything that is dead shall be re-grown
blink-182,"And your vicious pain, your warning sign"
blink-182,You will be fine hey yo here I am
blink-182,And here we go
blink-182,Life's waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown
blink-182,Like every single tree reach for the sky
blink-182,If you're gonna to fall
blink-182,I'll let you know
blink-182,That I will pick you up
blink-182,Like you for I
blink-182,I felt this thing
blink-182,I can't replace
blink-182,Where everyone was working for this goal
blink-182,Where all the children left without a trace
blink-182,Only to come back as pure as gold
blink-182,To recite this so
blink-182,hey yo here I am
blink-182,And here we go
blink-182,Life's waiting to begin
blink-182,Tonight

blink-182,Life's waiting to begin. With all of this I know now
blink-182,Everything inside of my head
blink-182,It all just goes to show how
blink-182,Nothing I know changes me at all
blink-182,Again I waited for this to change instead
blink-182,To tear the world in two
blink-182,Another night with her
blink-182,But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
blink-182,We know where we go
blink-182,Use me Holly come on and use me

blink-182,Everything inside of my heart
blink-182,It all just seems to be how
blink-182,Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
blink-182,Again I waited for this to pull apart
blink-182,To break my time in two
blink-182,Another night with her
blink-182,But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
blink-182,We know where we go

blink-182,She's all I dream
blink-182,She's all I'm always wanting you And all again I wait for this
blink-182,"To fill a whole, to shake the sky in two"
blink-182,Another night with her
blink-182,I'm always wanting you
blink-182,Another night with her
blink-182,"But I'm always wanting you Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you"
blink-182,And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
blink-182,"I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic"
blink-182,"I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,"La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,"La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor"
blink-182,"Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore"
blink-182,"I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand"
blink-182,"Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles"
blink-182,"In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover"
blink-182,Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
blink-182,"Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,"La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,"La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor"
blink-182,Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore

blink-182,"Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor"
blink-182,Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
blink-182,"I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand"
blink-182,"Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name"
blink-182,Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
blink-182,Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
blink-182,"And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start Let me get this straight, do you want me here?"
blink-182,As I struggle through each and every year
blink-182,"And all these demons, they keep me up all night"
blink-182,They keep me up all night
blink-182,They keep me up all night Everyone's cross to bears are the crown they wear on endless holiday
blink-182,Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
blink-182,"Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day"
blink-182,"And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day Let me get this straight, do you want me here?"
blink-182,As I struggle through each and every year
blink-182,"And all these demons, they keep me up all night"
blink-182,They keep me up all night
blink-182,They keep me up all night
blink-182,They keep me up all night
blink-182,They keep me up all night I talk to you every now and then
blink-182,I never felt so alone again
blink-182,I stop to think at a wishing well
blink-182,My thoughts send me on a carousel Here I am standing on my own
blink-182,Not a motion from the telephone
blink-182,I know not a reason why
blink-182,Solitude's a reason to die Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
blink-182,As school life is a
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,I guess its just another
blink-182,(I had sex with your mother) night alone Now as I walk down the street
blink-182,I need a job just to sleep in sheets
blink-182,Buying food every once in a while
blink-182,But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
blink-182,I know now that nothing is free
blink-182,I talk to you every now and then
blink-182,I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
blink-182,As school life is a
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,I guess its just another
blink-182,Night alone Thanks a lot you guys!
blink-182,"Hey kids, it's Satan. Thanks a lot for coming on down to"
blink-182,The show tonight. Hope you all had a great time. I know I did
blink-182,"Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see"
blink-182,You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
blink-182,"And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth"
blink-182,"I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck"
blink-182,And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
blink-182,"On my lap, and talk about unicorns and flowers and things like that"
blink-182,"Maybe I'll even suck their blood. See ya kids later! Hey, how you guys doin' up in the back? Now from the top balcony"
blink-182,"Can I get an Amen? Now from the floor, can I get a Hallelujah? Now from"
blink-182,"All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah? On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,Something's wrong
blink-182,This is gonna shock them
blink-182,Nothing to hold on to
blink-182,We'll use this song
blink-182,To lead you on I learned a lot today
blink-182,Not sure if I'll get laid and
blink-182,Not sure if I'll fail or pass
blink-182,Kissed every girl in class
blink-182,Everybody would waste it all
blink-182,To have a summer that they could call
blink-182,A memory that's full of fun
blink-182,"Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,Something's wrong
blink-182,This is gonna shock them
blink-182,Nothing to hold on to
blink-182,We'll use this song
blink-182,To lead you on
blink-182,And break the truth
blink-182,With more bad news
blink-182,We left a scar
blink-182,Size extra large Sip a drink of the alcohol
blink-182,End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
blink-182,Eyes are red and my movements slow
blink-182,"Too high, got vertigo He took a shit in the bathroom tub"
blink-182,And fed the dog brownie drugs
blink-182,Tried hard not to get caught
blink-182,"He fucked a chick in the parking lot On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,Something's wrong
blink-182,This is gonna shock them
blink-182,Nothing to hold on to
blink-182,We'll use this song
blink-182,To lead you on
blink-182,And break the truth
blink-182,With more bad news
blink-182,We left a scar
blink-182,Size extra large Break a window and bust a wall
blink-182,Making fun of your friend's mom
blink-182,Turn the music up way too loud
blink-182,Charge the pizza to the house
blink-182,Everybody would waste it all
blink-182,To have a summer that they could call
blink-182,A memory that's full of fun
blink-182,"Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,Something's wrong

blink-182,To lead you on
blink-182,And break the truth
blink-182,With more bad news
blink-182,We left a scar
blink-182,Size extra large It'd be nice
blink-182,To have a blow job
blink-182,It would be nice

blink-182,"From your mom My Dearest,"
blink-182,"I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together, and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately."
blink-182,"I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself."
blink-182,"I keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess."
blink-182,"I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I'm sick of always hearing"
blink-182,All the sad songs on the radio
blink-182,All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
blink-182,"That he's lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show"
blink-182,We would stay up all through the night
blink-182,We would laugh and get high
blink-182,And never answer the phone I can't forgive
blink-182,Can't forget
blink-182,Can't give in what went wrong
blink-182,'Cause you said this was right
blink-182,You fucked up my life I'm sick of always hearing
blink-182,Sappy love songs on the radio
blink-182,This place is fucking cursed in its plague
blink-182,And I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can't forgive
blink-182,Can't forget
blink-182,Can't give in what went wrong
blink-182,Cause you said this was right
blink-182,You fucked up my life I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
blink-182,What went wrong I'm kicking Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
blink-182,Don't wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?
blink-182,Where did I go wrong?
blink-182,Sometimes I just don't know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving
blink-182,"We're not the same, we're two in a million"
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,"We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em"
blink-182,"We stood as one, the young and forgotten"
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,These are the good old days You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
blink-182,You're not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone's gone missing
blink-182,Everyone's done wrong
blink-182,Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving
blink-182,"We're not the same, we're two in a million"
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,These are the good old days

blink-182,We're getting out
blink-182,We were young and we're not growing up
blink-182,We're not growing up You're giving up
blink-182,We're getting out

blink-182,These are the good old days Last night it came as a picture
blink-182,"With a good reason, a warning sign"
blink-182,This place is void of all passion
blink-182,If you can imagine it's easy if you try
blink-182,Believe me I failed this effort
blink-182,I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
blink-182,This time where are you Houston
blink-182,Is somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I feel alone and tired
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I hope I won't forget you My head is made up of memories
blink-182,Most of them useless delusions
blink-182,This room is bored of rehearsal
blink-182,And sick of the boundaries
blink-182,I miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I feel alone and tired
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,This time I don't want to
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I feel alone and tired
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I hope I won't forget you Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I feel alone and tired

blink-182,I feel alone and tired
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,I hope I won't forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
blink-182,They question who we used to be
blink-182,Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
blink-182,The cigarette and gasoline I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
blink-182,Of going back to San Diego
blink-182,We bought a one way ticket
blink-182,So we could go see the Cure
blink-182,And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
blink-182,And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
blink-182,"Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)"
blink-182,"Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)"
blink-182,Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
blink-182,I read the sadness on your face I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
blink-182,Of going back to San Diego
blink-182,We bought a one way ticket
blink-182,So we could go see the Cure

blink-182,Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear
blink-182,All of the pain and the fear
blink-182,Your secrets filled up my ears
blink-182,Like the ocean blue
blink-182,I never wanted to know
blink-182,How deep these cuts on you go
blink-182,And like a river they flow
blink-182,To the ocean blue Going back to San Diego
blink-182,We bought a one way ticket
blink-182,So we could go see the Cure
blink-182,And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot

blink-182,The last contagious victim of this plague between us
blink-182,I'm sick with apprehension
blink-182,I'm crippled from exhaustion
blink-182,And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me This is the first (thing I remember)
blink-182,Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
blink-182,Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
blink-182,An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
blink-182,Where do we go (life's temporary)
blink-182,After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
blink-182,Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
blink-182,I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) Crossed the street
blink-182,Naked at night
blink-182,Bent over to show some moonlight
blink-182,Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
blink-182,Nude in a gutter is how I was found
blink-182,Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
blink-182,No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
blink-182,Now in prison for one month no one to see
blink-182,All I got is this guy Ben Dover Don't like hesh-don't like rap
blink-182,Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
blink-182,I'm a jerk I'm a punk
blink-182,Took a shower cause I stunk
blink-182,Smoked a bong killed a cat
blink-182,Had my nuts attacked by rats
blink-182,"Dad got nude, I wore a thong"
blink-182,For a hobby I make bombs Went to a farm to tip some cows
blink-182,Forgot that I left my pants down
blink-182,Bent over to pick them up
blink-182,Felt a twelve gauge next to my shit
blink-182,The farmer took me to his house
blink-182,Showed me the closet from the inside out
blink-182,The police came and took me away
blink-182,Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay Don't like hesh-don't like rap
blink-182,Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
blink-182,I'm a jerk I'm a punk
blink-182,Took a shower cause I stunk
blink-182,Smoked a bong killed a cat
blink-182,Had my nuts attacked by rats
blink-182,Dad got nude-I wore a thong
blink-182,"For a hobby I make bombs When the clock strikes two,"
blink-182,There's just so much to do
blink-182,And I can't explain what I need
blink-182,Jobs and social groups
blink-182,Hearing the latest news
blink-182,Keeping our reputations clean
blink-182,"And I, don't want to worry"
blink-182,About being on time
blink-182,I've seen the way you hurry
blink-182,And time runs your life
blink-182,Again
blink-182,The difference between east and west
blink-182,Money is so much less
blink-182,"Not that I'm poor, just to fine"
blink-182,I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
blink-182,And then we'd look
blink-182,Into the time
blink-182,"And I, don't want to worry"
blink-182,About being on time
blink-182,I've seen the way you hurry
blink-182,And time runs your life I talk to you every now and then
blink-182,I never felt so alone again
blink-182,I stop to think at a wishing well
blink-182,My thoughts send me on a carousel
blink-182,Here I am standing on my own
blink-182,Not a motion from the telephone
blink-182,I know not a reason why
blink-182,Solitudes a reason to die Just you wait and see
blink-182,As school life is a
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,I guess its just another
blink-182,I guess its just another night alone Now as I walk down the street
blink-182,I need a job just to sleep in sheets
blink-182,Buying food every once in a while
blink-182,But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
blink-182,I know now that nothing is free
blink-182,I talk to you every now and then
blink-182,I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see
blink-182,As school life is a
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,I guess its just another
blink-182,"I guess its just another night alone Let's get started, the faint and broken-hearted"
blink-182,"Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide"
blink-182,"Worst painkiller, that all-in filler"
blink-182,"The apart and departed look in my eyes Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land"
blink-182,Up through the clouds then back here
blink-182,"We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb"
blink-182,At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
blink-182,Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
blink-182,You left me on the day after Christmas
blink-182,"There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I will follow the trail to tomorrow"
blink-182,With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
blink-182,"Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers"
blink-182,"Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land"
blink-182,Up through the clouds then back here
blink-182,"We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb"
blink-182,At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
blink-182,Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
blink-182,You left me on the day after Christmas
blink-182,"There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I'm empty like the day after Christmas"
blink-182,Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
blink-182,You left me on the day after Christmas
blink-182,"There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight"
blink-182,Goodnight There she was like a starry night
blink-182,"Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes"
blink-182,And a heart of steel always on her own
blink-182,Almost never real
blink-182,When the night will begin
blink-182,The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
blink-182,Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
blink-182,Even if she falls in love
blink-182,And she was like a blade of ice
blink-182,Like a lonely road clears day of life
blink-182,Always sharp and cold always beautiful
blink-182,I am such a fool When the night will begin
blink-182,The pain won't end even if she falls in love
blink-182,Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
blink-182,Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
blink-182,Even if she falls in love and it isn't so bad it's
blink-182,Driving you mad even if she falls in love There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
blink-182,You said everything you'll ever say
blink-182,There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
blink-182,Anxiety's calling in my head Is it back again?
blink-182,Are you back again? Don't wake me up before you leave
blink-182,Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh)
blink-182,I feel your hand unlock the door
blink-182,Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh) What's the point of saying sorry now
blink-182,"Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out) What's the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)"
blink-182,"Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now) Dear head, shut up"
blink-182,I can't listen no more
blink-182,"It's late, so shut up"
blink-182,Is one night too much to ask for You are a haunted house
blink-182,You're superstitious
blink-182,You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
blink-182,I'm barely standing on the ground
blink-182,All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
blink-182,"I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again"
blink-182,"With you, with you, with you, with you again This bed, on fire"
blink-182,I can't sleep here no more
blink-182,Too late and tired
blink-182,Dreaming down on the floor I'm a haunted house
blink-182,I'm superstitious
blink-182,"I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole"
blink-182,I'm barely standing on the ground
blink-182,All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
blink-182,"I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again"
blink-182,"With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again"
blink-182,"With you, with you, with you, with you again I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down, I won't fall down)"
blink-182,I'm barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground)
blink-182,All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
blink-182,"I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole) Oh, oh"
blink-182,"Oh, oh"
blink-182,"Oh, oh"
blink-182,"Oh, oh"
blink-182,"Oh, oh"
blink-182,"Oh, oh"
blink-182,"Oh, oh, oh, oh Where the hell did you come from, outer space or heaven above"
blink-182,Short of breath my long-lost love
blink-182,"I can't believe my eyes, are you for real? My life before was such a mess"
blink-182,There's no use dwelling on the past
blink-182,My broken heart was in a cast
blink-182,Then you showed up and it began to heal 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing that's real
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing I feel Someday
blink-182,You'll come back to me
blink-182,And I'll say
blink-182,Something bitterly And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
blink-182,"Grab a knife, erase my vision"
blink-182,Take my flatscreen television
blink-182,And my paintings by Marilyn Manson 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing that's real
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing I feel 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing that's real
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing I feel Six bottles went down the drain
blink-182,One hours waste of time
blink-182,I'd ask if you feel the same
blink-182,Still pushing that chance to try
blink-182,Your breath in this cool room chill
blink-182,Long hair that blows side to side
blink-182,You speak and make time stand still
blink-182,"And each time walk right on by? Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me, forever, and after Can't count all the eyes that stare"
blink-182,Can't count all the things they see
blink-182,She kills with no life to spare
blink-182,Just victims left to bleed
blink-182,One drink and the pain goes down
blink-182,Soft shadows lay by her feet
blink-182,Lay soft as you slowly drown
blink-182,Lay still while you fall asleep
blink-182,"(Fall asleep) Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me, forever and after"
blink-182,"(And after, and after, and after) Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me,"
blink-182,"Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me, forever and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me, forever and after Push it out, fake a smile"
blink-182,Avert disaster just in time
blink-182,"I need a drink, cause in a while"
blink-182,Worthless answers from friends of mine
blink-182,"It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore"
blink-182,Girls possess me but they're never mine
blink-182,I made my entrance
blink-182,Avoided hazards
blink-182,Checked my engine I fell behind I fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
blink-182,And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
blink-182,I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
blink-182,I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy Remember when I was in
blink-182,"The grocery store, now's my time"
blink-182,"Lost the words, lost the nerve,"
blink-182,"Lost the girl, left the line"
blink-182,I would wish upon a star
blink-182,"But that star, it doesn't shine"
blink-182,"So read my book, with a boring ending"
blink-182,A short story of a lonely guy Who fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
blink-182,And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
blink-182,I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
blink-182,I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy She makes me feel like it's raining outside
blink-182,And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
blink-182,I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
blink-182,I get too scared to move cause I'm still
blink-182,"Just a stupid, worthless boy She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me"
blink-182,But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving The good intentions that you had
blink-182,Now only came to this
blink-182,And although she saw the mark
blink-182,The arrow missed It isn't exciting reciting the stories
blink-182,Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
blink-182,And both playing in punk rock bands
blink-182,The start was something good
blink-182,"But some good things must end And she said, ""It could never survive"
blink-182,With such differing lives
blink-182,"One home, one out on tour again We may never come back"
blink-182,The strike of a match
blink-182,"The candle's burning at both ends."" And now she knows too much"
blink-182,And I'm too fucked up
blink-182,It's awkward trying to make my move I'll pretend that I'm fine
blink-182,Show up right on time
blink-182,But I know I'll never be that cool I never wanted to hold you back
blink-182,I just wanted to hold on
blink-182,"But my chance is gone I know just where I stand, a boy"
blink-182,Trapped in the body of a man and I'll take what you're willing to give
blink-182,And I'll teach myself to live
blink-182,With a walk-on part of a background shot
blink-182,From a movie I'm not in She's so important
blink-182,And I'm so retarded And now I realize
blink-182,I should have kissed you in L.A.
blink-182,But I drove home all alone
blink-182,"As if I had a choice, anyway Where are you coming from?"
blink-182,What are you running from?
blink-182,Is it so hard to see? And if you're feeling scared
blink-182,Remember the time we shared
blink-182,You know it meant everything (everything)
blink-182,You know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago
blink-182,We might have had it all
blink-182,But I was so stupid then
blink-182,You needed time to grow
blink-182,But now just as things change
blink-182,As well my feelings do
blink-182,In time things rearrange
blink-182,I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get
blink-182,'Cause I just seem to lose
blink-182,You make me regret
blink-182,Those times I spent with you
blink-182,And playing those games
blink-182,A I wait for your call
blink-182,"And now I give up,"
blink-182,So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
blink-182,This time I'll get it right
blink-182,It's not a change of taste
blink-182,I was the one there last night You have your other friends
blink-182,They were there
blink-182,When you cried
blink-182,Didn't mean to hurt you then
blink-182,Best friends just won't
blink-182,Leave your side But what do I get
blink-182,'Cause I just seem to lose
blink-182,You make me regret
blink-182,Those times I spent with you
blink-182,And playing those games
blink-182,As I wait for your call
blink-182,"And now I give up,"
blink-182,So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
blink-182,This time I'll get it right
blink-182,It's not a change of taste
blink-182,I was the one there last night When I needed you most
blink-182,When I needed a friend
blink-182,You let me down now
blink-182,"Like I let you down then So sorry, it's over"
blink-182,(Ah) One thing / I don't know why
blink-182,It doesn't even matter how hard you try
blink-182,Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
blink-182,To explain in due time
blink-182,All I know
blink-182,time is a valuable thing
blink-182,Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
blink-182,Watch it count down to the end of the day
blink-182,The clock ticks life away
blink-182,It's so unreal
blink-182,Didn't look out below
blink-182,Watch the time go right out the window
blink-182,Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
blink-182,Wasted it all just to
blink-182,Watch you go
blink-182,I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
blink-182,What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
blink-182,so hard
blink-182,And got so far
blink-182,But in the end
blink-182,It doesn't even matter
blink-182,I had to fall
blink-182,To lose it all
blink-182,But in the end
blink-182,It doesn't even matter
blink-182,One thing / I don't know why
blink-182,It doesn't even matter how hard you try
blink-182,Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
blink-182,To remind myself how
blink-182,I tried so hard
blink-182,In spite of the way you were mocking me
blink-182,Acting like I was part of your property
blink-182,Remembering all the times you fought with me
blink-182,I'm surprised it got so (far)
blink-182,Things aren't the way they were before
blink-182,You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
blink-182,Not that you knew me back then
blink-182,But it all comes back to me
blink-182,In the end
blink-182,You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
blink-182,What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
blink-182,I tried so hard
blink-182,And got so far
blink-182,But in the end

blink-182,To lose it all
blink-182,But in the end
blink-182,It doesn't even matter
blink-182,I've put my trust in you
blink-182,Pushed as far as I can go
blink-182,For all this
blink-182,There's only one thing you should know
blink-182,I've put my trust in you
blink-182,Pushed as far as I can go
blink-182,For all this
blink-182,There's only one thing you should know
blink-182,I tried so hard
blink-182,And got so far
blink-182,But in the end
blink-182,It doesn't even matter
blink-182,I had to fall
blink-182,To lose it all
blink-182,But in the end
blink-182,It doesn't even matter I saw you again
blink-182,I think you used me again
blink-182,Should we try this before we give up and move on
blink-182,And pretend to restore what we have and hold on
blink-182,At times like these
blink-182,It's obvious
blink-182,I saw you again
blink-182,I know you fucked him again
blink-182,Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge
blink-182,Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these
blink-182,It's obvious
blink-182,At times like these
blink-182,It's obvious I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,"There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on"
blink-182,And I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,"There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on"
blink-182,And I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again

blink-182,"There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on"
blink-182,And I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,How do we fix this if we never have vision Day in day out
blink-182,Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
blink-182,Day in day out
blink-182,It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
blink-182,Whoa
blink-182,Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
blink-182,Whoa
blink-182,"Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth In Los Angeles, when will you save me"
blink-182,Los Angeles when will you save me

blink-182,"(I'm never coming, I'm never coming) Come down"
blink-182,I've been awake for days
blink-182,Knocked out
blink-182,By the sound of falling rain
blink-182,Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
blink-182,"Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me"

blink-182,I'm never coming home [Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
blink-182,Late at night on mercy street
blink-182,The summer air is way too sweet
blink-182,The way I feel inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach
blink-182,Something inside is incomplete
blink-182,I numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time
blink-182,I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home)
blink-182,The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
blink-182,(The last train home)
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home)
blink-182,The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
blink-182,(The last train home) [Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
blink-182,The tidal wave and aftermath
blink-182,I'm seasick from the years we've passed
blink-182,Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin
blink-182,She said goodbye and left again
blink-182,These empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time
blink-182,I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)

lin-manuel-miranda,Wrote everything down far as I could see
lin-manuel-miranda,I wrote my way out
lin-manuel-miranda,I looked up and the town had its eyes on me They passed a plate around
lin-manuel-miranda,Total strangers
lin-manuel-miranda,Moved to kindness by my story
lin-manuel-miranda,Raised enough for me to book passage on a
lin-manuel-miranda,Ship that was New York bound I wrote my way out of hell
lin-manuel-miranda,I wrote my way to revolution
lin-manuel-miranda,I was louder than the crack in the bell
lin-manuel-miranda,I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
lin-manuel-miranda,I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
lin-manuel-miranda,And in the face of ignorance and resistance
lin-manuel-miranda,I wrote financial systems into existence
lin-manuel-miranda,And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
lin-manuel-miranda,"I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance In the eye of a hurricane"
lin-manuel-miranda,There is quiet

lin-manuel-miranda,"But whatever it is, Jefferson started it Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning You're kidding I need a favor Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior Shh, talk less I'll use the press"
lin-manuel-miranda,"I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him I need you to draft an address Yes, he resigned, you can finally speak your mind No, he's stepping down so he can run for President Ha, good luck defeating you, sir I'm stepping down, I'm not running for President I'm sorry, what One last time"

lin-manuel-miranda,To say goodbye
lin-manuel-miranda,"You and I No, sir, why I wanna talk about neutrality Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time I want to warn against partisan fighting But Pick up a pen, start writing"
lin-manuel-miranda,I wanna talk about what I have learned
lin-manuel-miranda,The hard won wisdom I have earned As far as the people are concerned
lin-manuel-miranda,"You have to serve, you could continue to serve No, one last time"
lin-manuel-miranda,The people will hear from me
lin-manuel-miranda,One last time

lin-manuel-miranda,We're gonna teach 'em how to say
lin-manuel-miranda,Goodbye
lin-manuel-miranda,"You and I Mister President, they will say you're weak No, they will see we're strong Your position is so unique So I'll use it to move them along Why do you have to say goodbye If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on"
lin-manuel-miranda,It outlives me when I'm gone
lin-manuel-miranda,Like the scripture says
lin-manuel-miranda,Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
lin-manuel-miranda,And no one shall make them afraid
lin-manuel-miranda,They'll be safe in the nation we've made
lin-manuel-miranda,I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
lin-manuel-miranda,A moment alone in the shade
lin-manuel-miranda,At home in this nation we've made
lin-manuel-miranda,"One last time One last time Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration"
lin-manuel-miranda,I am unconscious of intentional error
lin-manuel-miranda,I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects
lin-manuel-miranda,Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors
lin-manuel-miranda,I shall also carry with me The hope
lin-manuel-miranda,That my country will
lin-manuel-miranda,View them with indulgence
lin-manuel-miranda,And that
lin-manuel-miranda,After forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
lin-manuel-miranda,The faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion
lin-manuel-miranda,As I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest

lin-manuel-miranda,"But just you wait What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton The issue on the table: a petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms. This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin, it cannot go ignored. If this comes to a vote in Congress, what is the White House's position? Secretary Jefferson, you first. Tread lightly... Sir"
lin-manuel-miranda,The constitution clearly states
lin-manuel-miranda,That the states have to wait
lin-manuel-miranda,Until eighteen-oh-eight to debate
lin-manuel-miranda,On whether to end the slave trade
lin-manuel-miranda,"And whether or not you want it, guys"
lin-manuel-miranda,That is the final compromise we made Sir wait- But for a second let us say that we can legislate
lin-manuel-miranda,"Unanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great"
lin-manuel-miranda,"We cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate"
lin-manuel-miranda,So back to Africa or do they get a separate state?
lin-manuel-miranda,"In 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West"
lin-manuel-miranda,My notion didn't get a single vote
lin-manuel-miranda,"Slavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer"
lin-manuel-miranda,But we can't address the question if we do not have an answer Is it my turn? Good
lin-manuel-miranda,Plantation states are packed with promise makers
lin-manuel-miranda,Do you realize the precious time these legislators wasted?
lin-manuel-miranda,Institutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles
lin-manuel-miranda,"Wait till the 1800's, and their population doubles"
lin-manuel-miranda,You all know
lin-manuel-miranda,This is the stain on our soul and democracy
lin-manuel-miranda,"A land of the free? No, it's not, it's hypocrisy"
lin-manuel-miranda,"To subjugate, dehumanize a race, call 'em property"
lin-manuel-miranda,"And say that we are powerless to stop it, can you not foresee?"
lin-manuel-miranda,"Sir, even you, you have hundreds of slaves"
lin-manuel-miranda,Whose descendants will curse our names when we're safe in our graves
lin-manuel-miranda,How will the south find labor for its businesses?
lin-manuel-miranda,"How will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses? How dare you Yet still, people follow like lemmings"
lin-manuel-miranda,"All your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings That's enough Well you asked how I feel"
lin-manuel-miranda,"I don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real If I may, Mr. President?"
lin-manuel-miranda,Madison?
lin-manuel-miranda,Let's take this moment to establish a precedent
lin-manuel-miranda,"First of all, sir, we won't involve you in this"
lin-manuel-miranda,"Imagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous"
lin-manuel-miranda,"I'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year"
lin-manuel-miranda,That was agreed upon
lin-manuel-miranda,That buys us time and assuages fear
lin-manuel-miranda,I'll tell the North that on January 1st
lin-manuel-miranda,"Of that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst"
lin-manuel-miranda,"Once I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen"
lin-manuel-miranda,"And introduce a notion never to discuss this again Mr President! Hamilton, if we support emancipation"
lin-manuel-miranda,Every single slave owner will demand compensation
lin-manuel-miranda,And as for slandering Jefferson with talk of mistresses
lin-manuel-miranda,"Do you really wanna- Do you really wanna have that conversation? No Madison, execute your plan to the letter"
lin-manuel-miranda,Let's hope the next generation thinks of something better I saved every letter you wrote me

michael-jackson,Returning on beams of light
michael-jackson,Scared of the moon
michael-jackson,The feeling of terror

michael-jackson,Has turned from a fantasy
michael-jackson,Into the truth
michael-jackson,The moon is the enemy
michael-jackson,Twisting her soul
michael-jackson,And taking its fearful toll
michael-jackson,Scared of the moon
michael-jackson,But now there are others who sit in a room
michael-jackson,And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
michael-jackson,Together they gather
michael-jackson,Their lunacy shade
michael-jackson,But knowing just why they're scared
michael-jackson,Scared of the moon

rihanna,Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose So how come when I reach out my finger
rihanna,It feels like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
rihanna,We're ten thousand miles apart
rihanna,I've been California wishing on these stars
rihanna,"For your heart on me, my California king Eye to eye, cheek to cheek"
rihanna,"Side by side, you were sleeping next to me"
rihanna,"Arm in arm, dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn"
rihanna,And a little last night on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers
rihanna,It seems like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
rihanna,We're ten thousand miles apart
rihanna,I've been California wishing on these stars
rihanna,"For your heart on me, my California king Just when I felt like giving up on us"
rihanna,You turned around and gave me one last touch
rihanna,That made everything feel better
rihanna,And even then my eyes got wetter So confused wanna ask you if you love me
rihanna,But I don't wanna seem so weak
rihanna,Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
rihanna,We're ten thousand miles apart
rihanna,California wishing on these stars
rihanna,"For your heart on me, my California king My California king"
rihanna,My California king In this California king bed
rihanna,We're ten thousand miles apart
rihanna,I've been California wishing on these stars
rihanna,"For your heart on me, my California king That's how much I love you"

rihanna,Can I not like you for awhile? (No) But you won't let me
rihanna,"You upset me, girl"
rihanna,And then you kiss my lips
rihanna,All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
rihanna,Can't remember what you did (But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
rihanna,So that I can't stay mad at you
rihanna,"For too long, that's wrong (But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch"
rihanna,So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
rihanna,"Said I despise that I adore you And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)"
rihanna,I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
rihanna,"And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)"
rihanna,But I just can't let you go
rihanna,And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)
rihanna,"The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh) Sad, and it's not fair"
rihanna,How you take advantage of the fact
rihanna,That I love you beyond a reason why
rihanna,"And it just ain't right And I hate how much I love you, girl"
rihanna,I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
rihanna,"And I hate how much I love you, girl"
rihanna,But I just can't let you go
rihanna,But I hate that I love you so One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
rihanna,And your kiss won't make me weak
rihanna,But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
rihanna,So you'll probably always have a spell on me
rihanna,"Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That's how much I love you (how much I need you)"
rihanna,That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
rihanna,"That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)"
