adele,That we might be exactly like we were
adele,You'll never know if you never try
adele,'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
adele,"Yours too baby, come on now"
adele,I'm trying to be brave
adele,I often think about where I went wrong
adele,When the day is done
adele,You shower me with words made of knives
adele,I'll be better for you This is the end
adele,I could offer you a warm embrace
adele,At the dawning of the day
adele,It illuminates all of my doubts
adele,Why do I hate the idea of being free?
adele,You're like a dream come true
adele,Made my way into the sun
adele,Make up memories in my head
adele,Tell me was it all for the thrill?
adele,You're out of control with nobody around to help
adele,Why do you love me
adele,Who wants to be right as rain
adele,You could help me ease my mind
adele,In fields of dawn and forests of the night
adele,I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
adele,"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
adele,It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,"Your name I set fire to the rain,"
adele,Don't look back at this crumbling fool
adele,And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
adele,Feel the pain running through my veins
adele,"Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face"
adele,"`cause you and me, we`re good"
adele,I want you to love me
adele,It illuminates all of my doubts
adele,"Oh, and turned me off"
adele,But I would never do you wrong
adele,You make it look like I'm see-through
adele,They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
adele,And everything you do's a game
adele,Feel the earth move and then
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,And your heart makes you feel like a fool
adele,It's hard to understand just why
adele,We both know we ain't kids no more
adele,"Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in"
adele,Face it all together Let the sky fall
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
adele,Don't underestimate the things that I will do
adele,"Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door"
adele,And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
adele,so I can forget about you
adele,Just in case it hasn't gone
adele,Making memories using my eyes
adele,"You may have my number, you can take my name"
adele,Think of me in the depths of your despair
adele,Let this be the way we remember us
adele,Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
adele,Lay me down (through the night)
adele,That I give in to my pretendings
adele,No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
adele,"Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you"
adele,"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
adele,"But it don't matter, it clearly"
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,It's out of my hands
adele,So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
adele,"If this is ain't love, then what is?"
adele,When I feel left out
adele,Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
adele,"Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind"
adele,It feels like we're oceans apart
adele,I'm heading straight for you
adele,"Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
adele,I need to fight my own
adele,They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
adele,"I won't ask you, you to just desert me"
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
adele,Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
adele,Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
adele,At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
adele,Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
adele,Go to the ends of the Earth for you
adele,But if I hurt you
adele,That I will be your remedy
adele,I can't give you what you think you gave me
adele,"Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,You are the peak and art of my universe
adele,That heart you caught must be waiting for you
adele,Made my way into the night
adele,You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
adele,However long I stay I will always love you
adele,Don't pretend that you don't want me
adele,"That I never knew, never knew"
adele,Are the wonders of my world
adele,You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
adele,Shows that we are united Round my hometown
adele,It was just like a movie
adele,"That I will be, I will be, I will be"
adele,To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
adele,And the things I think just don't make sense
adele,Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
adele,I could hold you for a million years
adele,Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
adele,I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
adele,"You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), umm"
adele,"I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong"
adele,"You like to be so close, I like to be alone"
adele,"So let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,"I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,"
adele,So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
adele,Will he still love me even when he's free
adele,It was just like a song
adele,And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
adele,Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
adele,And that scares me the most
adele,"But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh"
adele,To hold in your arms
adele,"That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep"
adele,So wipe that dirty smile off
adele,You never seem to make it through the door
adele,"Even when I've had too much,"
adele,I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
adele,"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,"Love to you, ooh yeah"
adele,"But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more"
adele,"Help, help oh oh. Chorus:"
adele,Have I ever asked for much?
adele,"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late"
adele,"If you're ready, if you're ready"
adele,We will stand tall Where you go I go
adele,"You set me free, oh Send my love to your new lover"
adele,You had my heart inside of your hand
adele,When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
adele,"I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,"
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,Four cold walls without parole
adele,It's out of my hands
adele,I've known it from the moment that we met
adele,And they could never tear us apart We could live
adele,Like we're not scared of what's coming next
adele,And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
adele,And I just want to make love to you
adele,"And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you"
adele,Running back to mommy hoping that she's home
adele,"Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall"
adele,Put myself behind a jailhouse door
adele,I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
adele,"That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
adele,Our love ain't water under the bridge
adele,Send my love to your new lover
adele,You had my heart inside of your hand
adele,Put a kiss on top of your head
adele,Fed up of biding your time
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you"
adele,Our love ain't water under the bridge
adele,Then sees you through There's no way I
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
adele,Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
adele,I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
adele,I don't even wanna waste your time
adele,Looks good when he walks
adele,There you are the devil on my shoulder
adele,Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
adele,Fed up of biding your time
adele,It was just like a song When we were young
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes"
adele,"And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,"
adele,Let the weight take me under
adele,Everything just takes me back
adele,And I ain't asking for forgiveness
adele,Are the wonders of my world
adele,What you see I see
adele,"Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain"
adele,"But the more I do,"
adele,"I was running, you were walking"
adele,There is nothing you can't do
adele,A thousand miles and poles apart
adele,And we'll stand Let the sky fall
adele,"Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love"
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
adele,"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
adele,Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
adele,"I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby"
adele,And try to break the backbone that I've grown
adele,"Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds"
adele,I'm willing to take the risk
adele,I can't bare to see the light
adele,I promise you will see
adele,"Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?"
adele,"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
adele,"You set me free, oh Send my love to your new lover"
adele,He can't do it on his own
adele,"To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only"
adele,And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
adele,When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,"I've never known this, never before"
adele,"To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,"Trust me I've learned it So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only"
adele,Made my way into the night
adele,Face it all together Let the skyfall
adele,"I miss you, I miss you"
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,So steady as she goes
adele,"You can read my mind, be it truth or lies"
adele,"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
adele,I don't regret a thing
adele,Our love ain't water under the bridge
adele,"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
adele,We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,"I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,"
adele,Even if it leads nowhere
adele,Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
adele,Towards me from across the room
adele,Deep down I must have always known
adele,"Where love is lost, your ghost is found"
adele,"Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong"
adele,That was what you told me I'm giving you up
adele,"you would think that I was crazy,"
adele,I will lay down my heart
adele,"But it don't matter, it clearly"
adele,"Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life"
adele,I've been learning to live without you
adele,Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
adele,Darling this is goodbye Oh
adele,Shows that we ain't gonna take it
adele,Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
adele,"The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
adele,There is something in your loving
adele,All I ask is If this is my last night with you
adele,That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do is make your bread
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all"
adele,And I'm all you need and that you never want more
adele,To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
adele,"I miss you, I miss you"
adele,I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
adele,And they're all having babies
adele,Build your world around me
adele,There's so many shades of black
adele,I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
adele,"That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door"
adele,When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
adele,"It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see"
adele,I'll put my hands up
adele,"If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)"
adele,You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
adele,And fly around in circles
adele,But if she's not there and you're on your alone
adele,This time you're on your own
adele,Take it all with my love This is how the story went
adele,Trust me I've learned it
adele,"It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat"
adele,And no one had blame
adele,I'm movin' on The other night
adele,Or at least as far as I thought I knew
adele,And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
adele,"'cause you're the only one I want, yeah"
adele,We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,"But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,I don't want to keep you indoors
adele,You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
adele,Give me a memory I can use
adele,"Well, it burned while I cried"
adele,Plus he's there for you
adele,But I want you to be true
adele,"Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby"
adele,Just look and you will see
adele,"Learning to fly, learning to run"
adele,I quit I'm movin' on
adele,That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do baby is make your bread
adele,To scratch my itch and beat my drum
adele,What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
adele,"Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust"
adele,They've all been said before you know
adele,I want you to love me
adele,"Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true."
adele,I heard that your dreams came true
adele,Hold your breath and count to ten
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love"
adele,I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
adele,Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
adele,Without one dollar to my name
adele,I can take a lot
adele,"Yes, I swam dirty waters"
adele,And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
adele,"He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait"
adele,whenever I start to think about you
adele,That the both of us
adele,I've cried my heart out
adele,"I fall short each time,"
adele,Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
adele,"Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
adele,(Steady as she goes) Steady as she goes
adele,"All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true"
adele,"It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat"
adele,Send my love to your new lover
adele,But like everything I've ever known
adele,I say your name like there should be an us
adele,Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
adele,"Pull me in, hold me tight"
adele,You can't make your heart feel
adele,(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all"
adele,Waiting as my heart drops
adele,And I just want to make love to you
adele,Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
adele,I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
adele,You drift into my head
adele,"I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,"
adele,And I will always love you
adele,"I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us"
adele,So desperately I try to link it with my head
adele,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
adele,And face it all together
adele,I want you to love me
adele,"I'll be better to you,"
adele,"No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me"
adele,"You think we would and we do,"
adele,Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
adele,I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
adele,"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
adele,"If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)"
adele,"All of my life, I've been frozen"
adele,All the things you'd say
adele,I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
adele,Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
adele,"Oh, oh Let it burn, oh"
adele,And the whole world is on your case
adele,And I think that I know things may never change
adele,The reason you loved me before
adele,Don't pretend that you don't want me
adele,Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
adele,and all the stupid things that love has put me through
adele,"At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me"
adele,To the way you move
adele,The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
adele,I've cried my heart out
adele,I met someone by accident
adele,And there is no one there to dry your tears
adele,Say that you love me in your last goodbye
adele,But how will you ever know if you never try
adele,But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
adele,"Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall"
adele,And as it fell you rose to claim it
adele,"I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby"
adele,"You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up"
adele,"I ain't lost, just wandering"" Round my hometown"
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,I won't face your fears
adele,I will always love you
adele,"Why were you so cold, let the truth be told"
adele,(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
adele,"And, boy, she's bringing you down"
adele,Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
adele,Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,To when you were there
adele,But instead I fall back to my knees
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,"Love to me, ooh baby"
adele,Lay me down (through the night)
adele,The scars of your love remind me of us
adele,"Oh if only, if only you knew"
adele,I will lay down my heart
adele,And neon lights and waiting papers
adele,I know this is love but If I tell the world
adele,When the day is done
adele,"Excuse me first love, but we're through"
adele,you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
adele,"But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,A thousand miles and poles apart
adele,But I want to live
adele,I know some clothes you left behind.
adele,'Cause I can't make you love me
adele,"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
adele,Let it burn while I cry
adele,"Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew"
adele,"Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,"
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,you came along and changed my mind
adele,You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,"Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
adele,Don't look back at this crumbling fool
adele,So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
adele,As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
adele,I'll be better to you
adele,Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
adele,"Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired"
adele,"Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby"
adele,They help to fill the emptiness you've left
adele,And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
adele,"Well, it burned while I cried"
adele,"But go on and take it, take it all with you"
adele,Every time he ain't here
adele,When the day is done
adele,So come on and give me the chance
adele,'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
adele,"I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby"
adele,"They were never true, never true"
adele,I gave you heaven on a platter baby
adele,When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
adele,I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
adele,At least I know he's lying still
adele,Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
adele,Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
adele,"When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied"
adele,I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
adele,"And for what, and for what, and for what"
adele,'Cause then I don't see
adele,That I will be your remedy
adele,But I've heard one on you
adele,"Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?"
adele,Seems I love the things you do
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
adele,And I just want to make love to you
adele,It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
adele,So I can tell you that I was wrong
adele,I need to fight my own
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
adele,"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
adele,"So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted"
adele,Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
adele,The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
adele,'Cause I knew that that was
adele,I can't do it on my own
adele,"Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all."
adele,I won't rise until this battle's won
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
adele,You could help me ease my mind
adele,I need to get away to feel again
adele,Lay me down (Won't you)
adele,You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
adele,'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
adele,And face it all together
adele,I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
adele,Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
adele,I heard you've been missing me
adele,Don't need to think it over
adele,'Cause we are living worlds apart
adele,If you're not the one for me
adele,But when I call you never
adele,All the nickels and the dimes of your days
adele,My friends got their ladies
adele,This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
adele,No one has me like you do
adele,I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
adele,For everything that I've done
adele,"I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you"
adele,"If you're ready, I am ready"
adele,It matters how this ends
adele,I met someone by accident
adele,My friends got their ladies
adele,I want you to love me
adele,"Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)"
adele,It matters how this ends
adele,"I should let you find me,"
adele,I hid it in the seam of your coat
adele,You make me feel like I am free again
adele,Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
adele,It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
adele,"You know my heart, more than I do"
adele,Who can't stand the reflection that they see
adele,Send my love to your new lover
adele,"It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior"
adele,I love your precious heart I was standing
adele,"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down"
adele,Finally I can see you crystal clear
adele,It's taken all of my stake
adele,"You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew"
adele,"We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us"
adele,Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
adele,"Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall"
adele,In every face that I've ever known
adele,And as it fell you rose to claim it
adele,They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
adele,He can't do it on his own
adele,If it hadn't been for love
adele,Even now when it's already over
adele,"I should leave the past behind me,"
adele,Where worlds collide and days are dark
adele,Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
adele,So long to let my doubts go
adele,And making up the past
adele,We won't be making up
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,I'll put my hands up
adele,Sometimes I just feel it's only me
adele,Put your hand in my hand
adele,Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
adele,"When you don't, ooh don't"
adele,"Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
adele,Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
adele,"Love to you, ooh yeah"
adele,And if I stay I'll be alive
adele,I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
adele,"Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces"
adele,And I swore you moved overseas
adele,I'm going back to where I started
adele,Still how can you walk away
adele,I feel like my life is flashing by
adele,Nobody told me that you'd be here
adele,Make up memories in my head
adele,Your love drives me crazy
adele,"Even when I've had too much,"
adele,No I'm not gonna do it standing up
adele,But like everything I've ever known
adele,Your name I set fire to the rain
adele,"Lights go down, lights go down"
adele,Put a kiss on top of your head
adele,Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
adele,So why don't we just play pretend
adele,So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
adele,You say my name like there could be an us
adele,I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
adele,"I wish you'd come over,"
adele,"'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh"
adele,Hold your breath and count to ten
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,And we'll watch them turn to dust
adele,"If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)"
adele,Don't pretend that you don't want me
adele,I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
adele,"Whatever it is, I depend on it"
adele,Whenever I'm standing my own ground
adele,She made your heart melt
adele,I hid it in the seam of your coat
adele,I'm willing to take the risk
adele,I'm willing to take the risk
adele,But I want you to be true
adele,And I don't know why
adele,It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,I forgive you once again
adele,Finally could this be it or Should I give up
adele,I didn't know a single word he said
adele,They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
adele,Why do you love me
adele,He will choose the poison over me?
adele,"I was running, you were walking"
adele,And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
adele,"No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
adele,Hitting me like an explosion
adele,God only knows why it's taken me
adele,And wake up to your face against the morning sun
adele,You haunt me like a ghost
adele,We were born and raised in a summer haze
adele,I won't face your fears
adele,They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
adele,Did you find the note that I wrote?
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,"Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark"
adele,"Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no"
adele,I grow fonder every day
adele,Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
adele,"But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,"I won't ask you, you to just desert me"
adele,"You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said"
adele,I've drowned and dreamt this moment
adele,What you know is true
adele,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
adele,"Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life"
adele,"Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age"
adele,"Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why"
adele,"I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco."
adele,"through the ups and downs,"
adele,So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
adele,You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,"For the big one, for the big jump"
adele,"Pull me in, hold me tight"
adele,I wish nothing but the best for you
adele,Let's just say that maybe
adele,"Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war"
adele,so I can forget about you
adele,"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
adele,Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
adele,I miss you when the lights go out
adele,I don't even wanna waste your time
adele,With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
adele,That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do baby is make your bread
adele,But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
adele,"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
adele,"Well, it felt something died"
adele,"Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
adele,(Steady as she goes) Steady as she go
adele,Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
adele,Who wants to be right as rain
adele,Are the wonders of my world
adele,"Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool"
adele,"There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out"
adele,You're still not mentioning love
adele,Boy I'm tired of trying
adele,That we might be exactly like we were
adele,But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
adele,The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
adele,Baby don't let the lights go down
adele,And you played it to the beat
adele,You will only be eternally
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,When the day is done
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,The last time Let it burn
adele,"To whisper ""will you leave your man? """
adele,"You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), umm"
adele,It's been waiting for you to open up
adele,When I don't get nothing back
adele,I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
adele,Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
adele,"All my life, you're my darkness"
adele,Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
adele,Baby please remember me once more
adele,Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
adele,You can take my name
adele,To persist with this heartbreak and running around
adele,"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
adele,(Steady as she goes) So steady as she goes Your friends have shown
adele,I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
adele,I'll be better to you
adele,I wish nothing but the best for you two
adele,Love you When the pain cuts you deep
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told"
adele,Ooh the people I've met
adele,But my knees were far too weak
adele,However long I stay I will always love you
adele,At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
adele,I don't want you sad and blue
adele,"Out that door Well, I've been in town"
adele,And wake up to your face against the morning sun
adele,Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
adele,I wouldn't be wishing I was free
adele,"And you played it, to the beat"
adele,They make believe that everything
adele,You get the people and the government
adele,Now you need a wife Steady as she goes
adele,It was just like a song
adele,You say my name like there could be an us
adele,Count your blessings to find what you look for
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
adele,"Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?"
adele,Your love drives me crazy
adele,I know I left you speechless
adele,Only yesterday was the time of our lives
adele,Lay me down (I can baby)
adele,Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
adele,I hope that you're well
adele,I've drowned and dreamt this moment
adele,"Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk"
adele,"Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?"
adele,"Oh I, I miss my baby"
adele,You shower me with words made of knives
adele,I want to feel my heartbeat so
adele,I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
adele,Is we can break every low
adele,It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
adele,Just to make sure you're well fed
adele,I'll put my hands up
adele,We could have had it all
adele,You hang on every word I say
adele,But you pushed me in
adele,"Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
adele,It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
adele,'Cause I've been by myself all night long
adele,"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
adele,To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
adele,"You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core"
adele,I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
adele,At skyfall Let the sky fall
adele,"No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor"
adele,I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
adele,"`cause you and me, we`re good"
adele,Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
adele,I try to think of things to say
adele,It's like they're scared of me
adele,You and I have history
adele,Or would it be a waste?
adele,At skyfall Let the sky fall
adele,And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
adele,When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
adele,And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,So come on and give me the chance
adele,"Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior"
adele,Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
adele,Fed up of biding your time
adele,We almost fall apart and burn up easy
adele,"""No and thank you, please Madam."
adele,I don't care no more
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
adele,My impatience will come out to play
adele,"With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart"
adele,"But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,And there is something 'bout the way you love me
adele,Or would it be a waste?
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
adele,And I'm forever excusing your intentions
adele,Send my love to your new lover
adele,"but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,"
adele,You had my heart inside of your hand
adele,Because I'm too crazy for you.
adele,"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,"Don't let go, baby give me light"
adele,When we'll try to give it up
adele,They say that time's supposed to heal ya
adele,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
adele,"Ooh I, I miss my baby I don't want you to be no slave"
adele,"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
adele,"So I, I turned around"
adele,To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
adele,You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
adele,Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
adele,"It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat"
adele,"Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,"
adele,"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,"We both know we ain't kids no more If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)"
adele,He would be hard to chase
adele,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
adele,A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
adele,And it's been that way to long
adele,Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
adele,"You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining"
adele,Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
adele,Filling up my heart with golden stories
adele,I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
adele,That you are in my life
adele,There's a fire starting in my heart
adele,You may have my number
adele,When the night keeps you from sleeping
adele,"That I never knew, never knew"
adele,"That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now"
adele,As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
adele,How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
adele,At the mention of my name
adele,Even now when we're already over
adele,So watch them turn to dust
adele,I feel like my life is flashing by
adele,But if she's not there and you're on your alone
adele,And be all you need so that you never want more
adele,I still feel your touch
adele,To make me cry again
adele,"1 2 3 4. Fiasco, fiasco [Chorus:]"
adele,"I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot"
adele,How do you keep me coming back for more
adele,To make us grow from dust
adele,I'd make wine from your tears I told you
adele,It only makes it harder baby
adele,"Pull me in, hold me tight"
adele,It illuminates all of my doubts
adele,"So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,"
adele,You know I'm never gonna leave you
adele,"Help, help oh oh. Chorus:"
adele,I want you to love me
adele,Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
adele,You told me you were ready
adele,But they don't recognize me now
adele,But keep me making love to me
adele,If I'm in love with you Should I give up
adele,"Oh, baby, I feel so down"
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,so I can forget about you
adele,There's only one way down I'm giving you up
adele,Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
adele,"Let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,You spin a web in every room
adele,All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
adele,"They were never true, never true"
adele,All my words to hold
adele,But at least when you're at your worst
adele,I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
adele,Fed up of biding your time
adele,"Be the best, have success,"
adele,All that I have is on the floor
adele,"And you played it, to the beat"
adele,And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
adele,We could have had it all
adele,In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
adele,The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
adele,With eyes that make you melt
adele,Just give me till then
adele,"I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired"
adele,'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
adele,So wipe that dirty smile off
adele,(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
adele,And when you stand before the candles on a cake
adele,And face it all together
adele,I want you to love me
adele,Sell it to the crowd
adele,"No, we ain't kids no more I'm giving you up"
adele,Watched it pour as I touched your face
adele,And wake up to your face against the morning sun
adele,Ooh In the absence of security
adele,I want you to love me
adele,I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
adele,"You're so provocative, I'm so conservative"
adele,I know this for sure
adele,I wish nothing but the best for you two
adele,"Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes"
adele,"You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time"
adele,I find it funny that you're the only
adele,When we were younger and free
adele,"Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes"
adele,Are you steady now? Steady as she goes I'm insane in the brain
adele,Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
adele,To tell you I'm sorry
adele,"I find the less I look, more I find"
adele,That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do is make your bread
adele,If I'm wrong I am right
adele,Everybody here is watching you
adele,Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
adele,Take it as it comes
adele,Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
adele,You're the only one I want
adele,"Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now"
adele,"The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,"
adele,It had only just begun but now it's over now
adele,"Well, it burned while I cried"
adele,We will stand tall) Where you go I go
adele,I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
adele,I can't give you what you think you gave me
adele,you might think that I wanna be close to you
adele,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
adele,We both know we ain't kids no more
adele,You made me want you
adele,Cuz I left that night
adele,"Let's go back there, back to the star"
adele,And that's exactly what I need to do
adele,"Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made"
adele,"You set me free, oh Send my love to your new lover"
adele,That you and I are wrong
adele,"Lights go down, lights go down"
adele,Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
adele,And make me crazy for you.
adele,I know there is no tomorrow
adele,"It drags, as I lose my mind"
adele,The winds of change are blowing wild and free
adele,I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
adele,And neon lights and waiting papers
adele,I don't want you to work all day
adele,"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
adele,But if by chance you're here alone
adele,"Don't let go, baby give me light"
adele,I gave you everything you never gave me
adele,"If this ain't love, then what is?"
adele,And all I can do is watch and cry
adele,Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
adele,It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
adele,"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
adele,As far as I'm concerned
adele,Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
adele,(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
adele,We could have had it all
adele,Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
adele,Than you ever did me before.
adele,I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
adele,Lay me down (I can baby)
adele,So wipe that dirty smile off
adele,Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
adele,"I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
adele,"So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here"
adele,I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
adele,Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
adele,"Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself"
adele,Did you find the note that I wrote?
adele,She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
adele,"Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon"
adele,"Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must"
adele,You can say I chose to be alone
adele,Don't try to change my mind
adele,Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
adele,`cause I do but I really don`t want to
adele,It's hard to understand just why
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,"The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby"
adele,Trust me I've learned it
adele,We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
adele,"That I never knew, never knew"
adele,"Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees"
adele,"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
adele,I want your heaven and your ocean's too
adele,Just look and you will see
adele,And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
adele,I will always love you
adele,"I thought of me, I want to see"
adele,"And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk"
adele,But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
adele,"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
adele,'Cause you feel like home
adele,"I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me"
adele,To stand in your arms
adele,See how I leave with every piece of you
adele,"Lights go down, lights go down"
adele,But after you that goes on
adele,I still feel your touch
adele,"Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves"
adele,"Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me"
adele,I say we've only known each other one year
adele,And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
adele,We won't be making up
adele,"Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave"
adele,"Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that"
adele,At skyfall This is how the story went
adele,And I threw us into the flames
adele,"Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind"
adele,I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
adele,There is so much space between us
adele,(That is gathered round) Settle for a girl
adele,Four cold walls without parole
adele,Lay me down (I can baby)
adele,"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
adele,supposed to stay beside me
adele,Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
adele,"But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,"
adele,"My heart so bad, it cuts through"
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,"
adele,Boy I'm tired of trying
adele,You'll never see me again oh baby in time
adele,As far as I'm concerned
adele,I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
adele,"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
adele,Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! I heard that you're settled down
adele,"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,"
adele,I've had some bad love
adele,When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
adele,Brushing past my every groove
adele,"They were never true, never true"
adele,"Even when I've had too much,"
adele,But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
adele,I won't go! I can't do it on my own
adele,"Oh, and turned me off"
adele,You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
adele,To make us grow from dust
blink-182,She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
blink-182,She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
blink-182,Hope you enjoy it this time
blink-182,Here I am standing on my own
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,Unless you do this with me
blink-182,The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
blink-182,I'm so sick of fights I hate them
blink-182,The look in your eyes makes me crazy
blink-182,Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,Let me go in her room
blink-182,'Cause we got no control
blink-182,One more time with feeling She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
blink-182,Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
blink-182,And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
blink-182,"(I'm never coming, I'm never coming) Come down"

blink-182,Tomorrow holds such better days
blink-182,"'Cause girls are such a drag Eyes are, open words are spoken"
blink-182,I'm seasick from the years we've passed
blink-182,I need a job just to sleep in sheets
blink-182,And yesterday I thought of you
blink-182,Smiling from ear to ear
blink-182,If you're gonna to fall
blink-182,It makes no sense at all
blink-182,And it is way too unhealthy
blink-182,"Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm"
blink-182,Is one night too much to ask for You are a haunted house
blink-182,Everything's better when she's around
blink-182,And I won't be there and you're all alone
blink-182,"As if I had a choice, anyway Where are you coming from?"
blink-182,On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again
blink-182,I've been awake for days
blink-182,I'm on another planet with you
blink-182,And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
blink-182,"I'm empty as a movie set, it's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California"
blink-182,Comes creeping on so haunting every time
blink-182,We are the kings of the weekend It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
blink-182,(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
blink-182,Let's make this last forever
blink-182,In the dark awake and you're not around
blink-182,With the way that they dress
blink-182,We started alone in the end we're okay You said
blink-182,But let me call you when I'm sober Sober
blink-182,Bent over to pick them up
blink-182,Up in smoke with the fire we started
blink-182,Will you remember this night
blink-182,"We're not the same, we're two in a million"
blink-182,"She's the one, she'll always be there"
blink-182,"Cause I am, I'm lost without you"
blink-182,I'm on another planet with you
blink-182,"We'll never give up, it's no use"
blink-182,Always (Get ready for action!)
blink-182,I know not a reason why
blink-182,And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,It's awkward trying to make my move I'll pretend that I'm fine
blink-182,Everything has fallen to pieces
blink-182,And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
blink-182,'Cause in the end it's fuckin' useless
blink-182,You left me on the day after Christmas
blink-182,I'll shower you with lies
blink-182,"That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along"
blink-182,Dad got nude-I wore a thong
blink-182,"Worth another night in jail He's a player, diarrhea giver"
blink-182,"Life is too short to last long (Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)"
blink-182,"Well, I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,Nothing to hold on to
blink-182,I hope I won't forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
blink-182,"The world is wide, the time goes by"
blink-182,"Grab a knife, erase my vision"
blink-182,You fucked up my life I'm sick of always hearing
blink-182,Where you can always find me
blink-182,Long journeys wear me out but
blink-182,To face this on your own
blink-182,To pass the time in my room alone In the car I just can't wait
blink-182,"She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window"
blink-182,But I know we can't stay the same
blink-182,I feel numb and all or nothing
blink-182,And I won't be there and you're all alone
blink-182,What went wrong I'm kicking Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
blink-182,'Cause you're the one I miss
blink-182,You gave it all away
blink-182,Place your hand in mine
blink-182,"Are we cursed to this life Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go"
blink-182,"Turn the lights off, carry me home"
blink-182,I know not what I did
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) Yeah my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
blink-182,I'm on another planet with you
blink-182,Kissed every girl in class
blink-182,"Oh, is this thing on? I swear that I can go on forever again"
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home)
blink-182,We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
blink-182,Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
blink-182,Always And I'll miss your laugh your smile
blink-182,We might have had it all
blink-182,Like a lonely road clears day of life
blink-182,"The tour was over, we'd survived"
blink-182,"She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know"
blink-182,Meet me where the skyline ends
blink-182,The pictures in her head are always dreaming
blink-182,"We stood as one, the young and forgotten"
blink-182,Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
blink-182,Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
blink-182,"Once we had love, now it's gone"
blink-182,And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
blink-182,We were young and we're not growing up
blink-182,That I will pick you up
blink-182,Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh) I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this problem
blink-182,And I am sleeping with my clothes on
blink-182,"Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay"
blink-182,"And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth"
blink-182,"Well, I guess this is growing up Everything has fallen to pieces"
blink-182,I called her mom from a pay phone
blink-182,Buying food every once in a while
blink-182,But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
blink-182,"She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know"
blink-182,"Worst painkiller, that all-in filler"
blink-182,I screamed into a microphone
blink-182,"Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger"
blink-182,For a hobby I make bombs Went to a farm to tip some cows
blink-182,The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,Use me Holly come on and use me
blink-182,"I'm here, hold on, to me"
blink-182,"Cant forget, cant give in"
blink-182,I'll take you over if you let me
blink-182,And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
blink-182,"In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover"
blink-182,"Go on ahead, I'll meet you there, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and"
blink-182,And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
blink-182,I'm dying in this silence The last star left in heaven
blink-182,Often they've typically been starved for attention before She's open waiting for more
blink-182,"Yeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers)"
blink-182,I must have missed the kick off
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
blink-182,(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
blink-182,(this can't be the end)
blink-182,Want to make a deal
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh) that I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
blink-182,A I wait for your call
blink-182,One thing / I don't know why
blink-182,We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
blink-182,Remember the time we shared
blink-182,I got my eye on you
blink-182,Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
blink-182,One hours waste of time
blink-182,Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
blink-182,We know where we go
blink-182,I would like to find him Friday night
blink-182,To pick you up on our very first date
blink-182,And in the night we'll wish this never ends
blink-182,"And take, my one last breath"
blink-182,In its plague and I can never escape
blink-182,"It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end"
blink-182,Something bitterly And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
blink-182,"And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly"
blink-182,This awkward silence makes me crazy
blink-182,You know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago
blink-182,Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving
blink-182,"Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)"
blink-182,I'd still ask her to dance
blink-182,We'll fall apart on the weekend
blink-182,"Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'm lost without you"
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,Had my nuts attacked by rats
blink-182,I came inthrough the windo last night It's no suprise to me
blink-182,I need a job just to sleep in sheets
blink-182,To keep going So just take my hand
blink-182,"I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover"
blink-182,"Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide"
blink-182,I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
blink-182,"This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful I haven't been this scared in a long time"
blink-182,With green eyes and long blonde hair
blink-182,And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh life is too short to last long)
blink-182,You're to blame Let this train wreck burn more slowly
blink-182,These are the good old days You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
blink-182,My car is in the front yard
blink-182,We'll have Halloween on Christmas
blink-182,'Cause I just seem to lose
blink-182,"I didn't mean to call you that I, I can't get you more pregnant"
blink-182,Of apple juice in the hall
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,Take me away from here
blink-182,"Lost the girl, left the line"
blink-182,But I know we can't stay the same
blink-182,Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
blink-182,I lost my head on the door She's a-a-a-antisocial
blink-182,When I'm broken There's a halo in the distance
blink-182,"The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)"
blink-182,I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
blink-182,But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
blink-182,Like I'm the one full of regret
blink-182,You fucked up my life I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
blink-182,Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
blink-182,I know I've seen you trashed
blink-182,Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
blink-182,"Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight"
blink-182,I remember the look her mother gave us
blink-182,Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
blink-182,There's just so much to do
blink-182,We would laugh and get high
blink-182,life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
blink-182,I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy She makes me feel like it's raining outside
blink-182,Left you in the bar to try and save face You can only lean on me for so long
blink-182,One more time with feeling
blink-182,And as I stared I counted
blink-182,On the street with a cigarette
blink-182,This time I'll get it right
blink-182,"Can you remember, you remember the last night"
blink-182,Long hair that blows side to side
blink-182,It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
blink-182,Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
blink-182,"I need a girl that I can train She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare"
blink-182,Let's make this last forever Let's go
blink-182,This time I don't want to
blink-182,Are you afraid of being alone
blink-182,(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
blink-182,"I guess its just another night alone Let's get started, the faint and broken-hearted"
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
blink-182,We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
blink-182,Place your hand in mine
blink-182,More than just sticks and stones
blink-182,Smoked a bong killed a cat
blink-182,Had my nuts attacked by rats
blink-182,"Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go"
blink-182,Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
blink-182,"Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see"
blink-182,Will you remember this night
blink-182,Often they've typically been starved for attention before She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
blink-182,"Los Angeles, I'm never coming home"
blink-182,I remember it's the first time that I saw her there She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
blink-182,"Yeah, we both sang, ""Why can't I get one kiss?"" We are forgotten young suburbia"
blink-182,I came in throught the window... Last night
blink-182,"Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
blink-182,Days when I still felt alive
blink-182,I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
blink-182,We all need something to live for It's hard to wake up
blink-182,Can't give in what went wrong
blink-182,To have a blow job
blink-182,This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
blink-182,"Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone"
blink-182,I am my own worst enemy
blink-182,Everything you wished came true
blink-182,She left me roses by the stairs
blink-182,The night will go on
blink-182,I need somebody and always
blink-182,So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
blink-182,"And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start Let me get this straight, do you want me here?"
blink-182,We'll fall apart on the weekend
blink-182,Stand up straight and tall and shout about it I think I'm on another world with you
blink-182,"I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down"
blink-182,"Pick me up now, I need you so bad."
blink-182,They keep me up all night Everyone's cross to bears are the crown they wear on endless holiday
blink-182,Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
blink-182,Size extra large Sip a drink of the alcohol
blink-182,And I hold on tight
blink-182,Driving you mad even if she falls in love There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
blink-182,And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here
blink-182,"(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over Save your breath, I'm nearly"
blink-182,'Cause I love your little motions
blink-182,"Cause I am, I'm lost without you"
blink-182,"Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night"
blink-182,"Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,With many years ahead to fall in line
blink-182,He would say you got to turn your back and run now
blink-182,There's only one thing you should know
blink-182,Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
blink-182,And I'll do it again
blink-182,You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
blink-182,"There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight"
blink-182,You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
blink-182,I never wanted to know
blink-182,The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
blink-182,"Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home"
blink-182,We know where we go
blink-182,This time where are you Houston
blink-182,"The tour is over, I've survived"
blink-182,It makes no sense at all
blink-182,They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
blink-182,How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,While I'm drowning in the next room
blink-182,At the world around me
blink-182,"All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah? On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,"The world was wide, too late to try"
blink-182,To have a blow job
blink-182,"But my chance is gone I know just where I stand, a boy"
blink-182,I would like to find him Friday night
blink-182,Pushed as far as I can go
blink-182,'Cause we got no control
blink-182,And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
blink-182,And I am sleeping with my clothes on
blink-182,"But I'm always wanting you Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you"
blink-182,And I can't just swallow it
blink-182,Let's make this last forever I've been here before a few times
blink-182,Give all my things to all my friends
blink-182,It's not right So here's your holiday
blink-182,How can you say you meant anything different
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
blink-182,(The last train home) [Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
blink-182,"It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose"
blink-182,Hope you enjoy it this time
blink-182,And I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,I watched the fire burn the sea
blink-182,"And I am not fine, last night I saw you online"
blink-182,And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
blink-182,You're not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone's gone missing
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,Catching things and eating their insides
blink-182,You haven't got a chance now Need a girl that I can train
blink-182,In my bed back at home watching TV alone
blink-182,And as I stared I counted
blink-182,Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
blink-182,I read the sadness on your face I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
blink-182,I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep
blink-182,Meet me where the skyline ends Los Angeles when will you save me
blink-182,"But that star, it doesn't shine"
blink-182,"Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work"
blink-182,And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,"I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep"
blink-182,Up in smoke with the fire we started
blink-182,The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
blink-182,You fucked up my life Im sick of always hearing
blink-182,"I didn't mean to call you that Come here, please hold my hand LORD now"
blink-182,I can take care of myself. Remember the days
blink-182,Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) All the small things
blink-182,Seventeen without a purpose or direction
blink-182,"Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day"
blink-182,Everything has fallen to pieces
blink-182,And I'm too fucked up
blink-182,I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get
blink-182,"There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on"
blink-182,"Turn the lights off, carry me home"
blink-182,Were taking this way too slow
blink-182,Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
blink-182,We'll waste the best nights of our life
blink-182,That I stayed over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
blink-182,Life is too short to last long
blink-182,"Los Angeles, when will you save me"
blink-182,"Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight"
blink-182,"Yeah, we both sang, ""Why can't I get one kiss?"" We are forgotten young suburbia"
blink-182,"I acted like an ass, I'd"
blink-182,Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,"Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken"
blink-182,Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
blink-182,And I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
blink-182,These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
blink-182,End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
blink-182,We bought a one way ticket
blink-182,Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
blink-182,"We'll never give up, it's no use"
blink-182,It's not right I can't get my feet up off the edge
blink-182,Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
blink-182,"I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist"
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,"(I miss you, miss you)"
blink-182,I can breathe for a while
blink-182,"You'll close it off, board it up"
blink-182,"For a hobby I make bombs When the clock strikes two,"
blink-182,Place your hand in mine
blink-182,Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
blink-182,Bored to death and fading fast
blink-182,You gave it all away
blink-182,You'll turn to a friend
blink-182,It all just goes to show how
blink-182,The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
blink-182,After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
blink-182,With you You get under my skin
blink-182,Is falling down to earth and
blink-182,Since I have used that line You couldn't wait for something new
blink-182,"Na, na na, na na, na na"
blink-182,"My little windmill Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,"
blink-182,Most of them useless delusions
blink-182,Whatcha gonna do Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
blink-182,There ain't nothing I can do about it
blink-182,Everything inside of my heart
blink-182,Should we try this before we give up and move on
blink-182,"One home, one out on tour again We may never come back"
blink-182,And sick of the boundaries
blink-182,And I want to suck my dad
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again
blink-182,When the night will begin
blink-182,"La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor"
blink-182,My little windmill Please take me by the hand
blink-182,And I'll take you back if you'd have me
blink-182,But not enough to hold you back It feels like the moon
blink-182,We go where we know With all of this I feel now
blink-182,"Los Angeles, when will you save me"
blink-182,"It's late, so shut up"
blink-182,The cigarette and gasoline I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
blink-182,The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
blink-182,Sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
blink-182,"""I'll write you once a week,"" she said Why does it feel the same"
blink-182,"Turn the lights off, carry me home"
blink-182,"There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I'm empty like the day after Christmas"
blink-182,We'll be there to try it again Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
blink-182,What went wrong? Im kicking out fiercely
blink-182,(Are we alone do you feel it)
blink-182,"I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself."
blink-182,I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
blink-182,Up through the clouds then back here
blink-182,All of the pain and the fear
blink-182,I couldn't wait till I got home
blink-182,Don't leave me here with this feeling
blink-182,The smoke alarm is going offf and there a cigarette
blink-182,She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
blink-182,But I know we can't stay the same
blink-182,I need a girl that I can train Need a girl that I can train
blink-182,Kiss you taste you all night
blink-182,"Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? Please don't remind me, put your past behind me"
blink-182,Can't count all the things they see
blink-182,Are you afraid of leaving tonight
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me, forever and after"
blink-182,I'm just scared of what you think
blink-182,Unless you do this with me
blink-182,Stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me you're already
blink-182,"She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down"
blink-182,And I'm quite aware we're dying
blink-182,Los Angeles when will you save me
blink-182,We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
blink-182,Place your hand in mine
blink-182,Black sedan ran a red light
blink-182,Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
blink-182,Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now
blink-182,"And each time walk right on by? Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,I've seen the way you hurry
blink-182,Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
blink-182,We'll be here to try it again Im sick of always hearing
blink-182,Days when I still felt alive
blink-182,But I drove home all alone
blink-182,"Cause I am, I'm lost without you"
blink-182,Should I go back should I go back should I
blink-182,She said goodbye and left again
blink-182,All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
blink-182,There's so much more that I needed and
blink-182,Choke my voice Say goodnight
blink-182,(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
blink-182,(All or nothing) It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
blink-182,Let's make this last forever
blink-182,A memory that's full of fun
blink-182,Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,This is gonna shock them
blink-182,She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
blink-182,The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
blink-182,"La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,I won't try to argue or hold it against you
blink-182,Mobs that rule the school and workplace
blink-182,Are you afraid of being alone
blink-182,Those times I spent with you
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
blink-182,Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
blink-182,Up in smoke with the fire we started
blink-182,We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
blink-182,We would stay up all through the night
blink-182,No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
blink-182,Our breathing has got too loud
blink-182,"And it's driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery"
blink-182,I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
blink-182,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh) I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
blink-182,You left me on the day after Christmas
blink-182,Kiss you taste you all night
blink-182,"Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here"
blink-182,"You'll be sorry when I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came"
blink-182,"We're not the same, we're two in a million"
blink-182,Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
blink-182,An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
blink-182,We would stay up all through the night
blink-182,When I needed a friend
blink-182,Loose on the streets of California
blink-182,hey yo here I am
blink-182,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
blink-182,A target that I'm probably gonna miss Let's go
blink-182,What the hell is call ID?
blink-182,But then I turned on the TV And that's about the time she walked away from me
blink-182,Please let me know that my one bad day will end
blink-182,"Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me"
blink-182,But I'm always looking out for you
blink-182,(I'll leave when I wanna) Fate fell short this time
blink-182,Living in the perfect weather
blink-182,"Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore"
blink-182,There's only one thing you should know
blink-182,"They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah"
blink-182,Please don't look at me with those eyes
blink-182,My car is in the front yard
blink-182,Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
blink-182,'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,"I'll give you yours, I won't take mine"
blink-182,Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,"Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody"
blink-182,"She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know"
blink-182,You can only lean on me for so long
blink-182,With a walk-on part of a background shot
blink-182,Of going back to San Diego
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
blink-182,And she was like a blade of ice
blink-182,(I had sex with your mother) night alone Now as I walk down the street
blink-182,"When I see you after class, you're hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me"
blink-182,You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
blink-182,She's all I'm always wanting
blink-182,The last contagious victim of this plague between us
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,They keep me up all night
blink-182,"From your mom My Dearest,"
blink-182,I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
blink-182,Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
blink-182,Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
blink-182,The police came and took me away
blink-182,She's not complicated-ated-ated at all I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
blink-182,"When I'm bent, when I'm cracked"
blink-182,You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
blink-182,With green eyes and long blond hair
blink-182,But now just as things change
blink-182,The shadow in the background of the morgue
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
blink-182,This place is void of all passion
blink-182,I'll leave when I wanna
blink-182,And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
blink-182,Even if your hope has burned with time
blink-182,"There's plenty more, girls are such a drag Fuck this place, I lost the war"
blink-182,I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) Crossed the street
blink-182,"We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb"
blink-182,Unless you do this with me
blink-182,Soon we'll all be gone
blink-182,"I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down"
blink-182,Don't waste your time on me you're already
blink-182,(Ah) One thing / I don't know why
blink-182,I've put my trust in you
blink-182,"Los Angeles, when will you save me"
blink-182,I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
blink-182,The clock ticks life away
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this problem
blink-182,I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
blink-182,"Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor"
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
blink-182,"Soon we'll all be gone Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around"
blink-182,Place your hand in mine
blink-182,Like I never did good for us both
blink-182,Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
blink-182,Let's take a walk out on the pier
blink-182,"And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay"
blink-182,"When I'm bent, when I'm cracked"
blink-182,This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
blink-182,Not a motion from the telephone
blink-182,Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
blink-182,Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
blink-182,They question who we used to be
blink-182,"It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end"
blink-182,The night will go on
blink-182,And your hands they shake with goodbyes
blink-182,"I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,Those times I spent with you
blink-182,"Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you"
blink-182,"I'm not bent, I'm not cracked"
blink-182,Where you can always find me
blink-182,On the go and it's way too late to play
blink-182,Again I waited for this to pull apart
blink-182,I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
blink-182,These are the good old days
blink-182,And it is way too unhealthy
blink-182,A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
blink-182,Don't wait for me I wish that we could save today
blink-182,"Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,"
blink-182,(Oh oh oh oh) so I come over and over and over
blink-182,We never wanted to be abused
blink-182,And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
blink-182,"Not that I'm poor, just to fine"
blink-182,"I'll leave when I wanna I said settle down, settle down everything is fine"
blink-182,Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
blink-182,Show me the bathroom mirror
blink-182,If we learn to forgive and accept who we are You said
blink-182,Tried hard not to get caught
blink-182,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
blink-182,Pushed as far as I can go
blink-182,"He fucked a chick in the parking lot On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,And I'll do it again
blink-182,I kinda like the little rush you get
blink-182,At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
blink-182,"To face this on your own, well I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up"
blink-182,Well I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
blink-182,I'm jealous of everybody in the room
blink-182,And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
blink-182,"Boots and braces, yellow laces"
blink-182,And she slapped me then she pulled me down
blink-182,"Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And if we can have another day"
blink-182,Loose on the streets of California
blink-182,"I need a drink, cause in a while"
blink-182,Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
blink-182,Why would you wish that on me?
blink-182,Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
blink-182,Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,"I took my time, I hurried up"
blink-182,Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
blink-182,A short story of a lonely guy Who fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
blink-182,She's all I'm always wanting you And all again I wait for this
blink-182,She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
blink-182,In the dark awake and you're not around
blink-182,Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
blink-182,Stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me you're already
blink-182,I climbed through your window at 3am
blink-182,So here I am are you ready
blink-182,Lay soft as you slowly drown
blink-182,Do you still feel the same way
blink-182,Comes creeping on so haunting every time
blink-182,Cuz every now and then I kick the livin' shit out of me Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk
blink-182,"Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home"
blink-182,Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
blink-182,But I know I'll never be that cool I never wanted to hold you back
blink-182,Soft shadows lay by her feet
blink-182,Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
blink-182,(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
blink-182,And if young love is just a game then
blink-182,"With you Another girl, who's loving you now"
blink-182,"Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon"
blink-182,And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
blink-182,Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
blink-182,I never felt so alone again
blink-182,I should have kissed you in L.A.
blink-182,But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
blink-182,We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
blink-182,I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
blink-182,(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
blink-182,"She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds"
blink-182,"Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work"
blink-182,And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
blink-182,I feel dumb and long night coming Did you steal my prayers I don't know where I was
blink-182,But not enough to slow you down I feel like the moon
blink-182,Where you can always find me
blink-182,"But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa"
blink-182,And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
blink-182,To explain in due time
blink-182,Now in prison for one month no one to see
blink-182,How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
blink-182,"Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land La da da da, da da da da"
blink-182,Tried to grow his hair out

blink-182,All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
blink-182,"Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here"
blink-182,I need some more time to fix this problem
blink-182,Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,"I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck"
blink-182,(Place your hand in mine)
blink-182,Neighbors and friends that you don't know
blink-182,(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show The drops of rain they fall all over
blink-182,As school life is a
blink-182,"Do you grin inside, you're killing me"
blink-182,"Left alone to wonder Mind is open, thoughts are woken"
blink-182,She's all I'm always wanting you
blink-182,Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
blink-182,So when you're dead and gone
blink-182,Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,You ran me over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
blink-182,There's no use dwelling on the past
blink-182,The night will go on
blink-182,Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
blink-182,So we could go see the Cure
blink-182,"With you, with you, with you, with you again This bed, on fire"
blink-182,"Hey, here's to you California Cut the skin to the bone"
blink-182,"There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I will follow the trail to tomorrow"
blink-182,Smoked a bong killed a cat
blink-182,All I hear are the many echoes of
blink-182,"I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist"
blink-182,"(Na, na na, na na, na na"
blink-182,It is a woken dream
blink-182,Charge the pizza to the house
blink-182,(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time
blink-182,The universe an empty place without you I wish that we could save today
blink-182,A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
blink-182,Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
blink-182,And it's driving me crazy I can't find the best in all of this
blink-182,The charade it won't last when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
blink-182,If you play the part then I will play mine
blink-182,What went wrong? Im kicking Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
blink-182,Showed me the closet from the inside out
blink-182,"Hey, here's to you California Wearing all black out on the beach"
blink-182,Like indecision to call you
blink-182,"To fight this, God has a master plan"
blink-182,They keep me up all night I talk to you every now and then
blink-182,"This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me I'll think about the times"
blink-182,"Turn the lights off, carry me home"
blink-182,"I wunna suck my dad, and my mom too, oh is this thing on? (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare"
blink-182,And in the night we'll wish this never ends
blink-182,I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
blink-182,(Are we alone do you feel it)
blink-182,I can't listen no more
blink-182,Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
blink-182,"Na, na na, na na, na na"
blink-182,"I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons"
blink-182,"To pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, when you came"
blink-182,As I wait for your call
blink-182,We couldn't wait to get outside
blink-182,"It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose"
blink-182,Is it so hard to see? And if you're feeling scared
blink-182,Head is loaded cards are folded
blink-182,Sappy love songs on the radio
blink-182,So here I am I'm trying
blink-182,Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,You said everything you'll ever say
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,Comes creeping on so haunting every time
blink-182,Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
blink-182,"She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head"
blink-182,"Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now) Dear head, shut up"
blink-182,"And now I, have come to realize"
blink-182,It all just seems to be how
blink-182,To have a blow job
blink-182,She took my hand and that made it I swear Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
blink-182,These are the good old days These are the good old days
blink-182,"The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)"
blink-182,Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
blink-182,I numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time
blink-182,And I'm quite aware we're dying Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
blink-182,"Just like last time, but a little worse, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and"
blink-182,She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
blink-182,And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me This is the first (thing I remember)
blink-182,Kiss you taste you all night
blink-182,We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
blink-182,(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Left alone
blink-182,"We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb"
blink-182,(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
blink-182,If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
blink-182,Still buring Please tell me why
blink-182,The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
blink-182,This time I'll get it right
blink-182,The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
blink-182,But then all that it means is
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing that's real
blink-182,I fell in love with the girl at the rock show When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
blink-182,How deep these cuts on you go
blink-182,You always play to win
blink-182,You make me nervous so I really can't eat Let's go
blink-182,Do you want to come to a party
blink-182,And I know that you dated other guys
blink-182,And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
blink-182,"And I, don't want to worry"
blink-182,Spending all night getting lost together I know I messed up and it might be over
blink-182,"There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on"
blink-182,I barely made it out alive
blink-182,Watch the time go right out the window
blink-182,Is spinning off into outer space without you
blink-182,We are the kings of the weekend I can feel my head falling off my neck
blink-182,Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
blink-182,I feel the darkness break upon her
blink-182,And yesterday I thought of you
blink-182,And the things they suggest to me I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
blink-182,We bought a one way ticket
blink-182,And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
blink-182,So here I am are you ready Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
blink-182,To have a summer that they could call
blink-182,This room is such a lonely place without you I wish that we could save today
blink-182,'Cause you're the only thing that's real
blink-182,I screamed into a microphone
blink-182,"Under the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time"
blink-182,Your vows of silence fall all over
blink-182,And I'll teach myself to live
blink-182,That none of this means anything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
blink-182,We all need something to live for
blink-182,I guess its just another
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,It's not right Their anger hurts my ears
blink-182,Quite half as much as I know I need her
blink-182,Your smile fades in the summer
blink-182,I won't try to argue or hold it against you
blink-182,Some girls try too hard to impress
blink-182,I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
blink-182,(I miss you I miss you) Where are you and I'm so sorry
blink-182,You will be fine hey yo here I am
blink-182,(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
blink-182,"Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go"
blink-182,Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
blink-182,"Turn the lights off, carry me home"
blink-182,What are you running from?
blink-182,Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh)
blink-182,"Do you grin inside, you're killing me"
blink-182,The Webs from all the spiders
blink-182,Fuck it it's such a blur
blink-182,Are you back again? Don't wake me up before you leave
blink-182,And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
blink-182,They can't trust me because I blew it once before Beige little boxes in a row
blink-182,"I'll be fine, it's not the first"
blink-182,I've seen the way you hurry
blink-182,Until I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there
blink-182,Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
blink-182,"It's so cold out tonight, I'll"
blink-182,My pride is more than all that I own
blink-182,I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
blink-182,"Like violence you kill me Like violence you have me, forever, and after"
blink-182,Na na na na na na
blink-182,The one where I wake up and I'm alive
blink-182,When the shades have been pulled shut
blink-182,I was the one there last night You have your other friends
blink-182,Nothing to hold on to
blink-182,I know that I was right
blink-182,Bored to death and fading fast
blink-182,Let's make this last forever
blink-182,All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
blink-182,Anything but I'd go through hell for you and I haven't been this scared in a long time
blink-182,With those things on their chests
blink-182,"I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together, and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately."
blink-182,"So read my book, with a boring ending"
blink-182,Place your hand in mine
blink-182,Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
blink-182,I think I'm fallin' asleep
blink-182,I hope I won't forget you My head is made up of memories

radiohead,A lack of oxygen from my life support
radiohead,Come on and let it out
radiohead,"This will be on my videotape, my videotape"
radiohead,I keep the wolf from the door
radiohead,Strobe lights and blown speakers
radiohead,"I can feel death, can see its beady eyes"
radiohead,"Yeah I need it, I needed attention"
radiohead,All these things we'll one day swallow whole
radiohead,My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
radiohead,When the power runs out we'll just hum
radiohead,"Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week"
radiohead,Trying to get out of the night
radiohead,But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,And sail us to the moon

radiohead,"Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive"
radiohead,"So glad, so glad you're mine"
radiohead,"I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want"
radiohead,And that's what really hurts
radiohead,All these things we'll one day swallow whole
radiohead,Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
radiohead,"Help me, call the doctor, put me inside"
radiohead,One day I'll get to you
radiohead,"Been thinking about you, and there's no rest"
radiohead,"Don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor"
radiohead,I will eat you alive

radiohead,The best you can is good enough
radiohead,"This machine will, will not communicate"
radiohead,Gather up the lust and soul
radiohead,And heads down a mountain
radiohead,Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
radiohead,Little by little by hook or by crook
radiohead,And there'll be no more lies
radiohead,"You can be, it's okay"
radiohead,"But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo"
radiohead,'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
radiohead,I wish I was special
radiohead,Can't get the stink off

radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,You're all dancing to my little red book
radiohead,You are all I need
radiohead,It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
radiohead,They don't know what I know
radiohead,There's a gap where we meet
radiohead,How come I end up where I belong

radiohead,A total waste of time
radiohead,This is what you'll get
radiohead,"Should I still love you, still see you in bed"
radiohead,Won't take my eyes off the ball again
radiohead,I can see you drowning
radiohead,Crushed like a bug in the ground
radiohead,Will not cry in public
radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,Trapped in your parked car
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,I am back to save the universe
radiohead,Has the light gone out for you?
radiohead,X will mark the place
radiohead,And if I could be who you wanted
radiohead,"I got the poison, poison and now I want more"

radiohead,"On what might have been,"
radiohead,Women and children first and the children first and the children
radiohead,Dedicated to all human beings
radiohead,"If you think this is over, then you're wrong"
radiohead,I want to see you smile again
radiohead,I would slip into the groove
radiohead,"Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings"
radiohead,And you can't offer me escape
radiohead,I can't kick your habit
radiohead,"Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then"
radiohead,"Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed"
radiohead,Sing the song of sixpence that goes
radiohead,We don't have any real friends
radiohead,"That we can create, that we can create"
radiohead,Before you run away from me
radiohead,Why should you care when I'm not there?
radiohead,Just to see what if
radiohead,"Should I still love you, still see you in bed"
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
radiohead,I float down the Liffey
radiohead,And fill up with noise
radiohead,It is the 21st century
radiohead,"So glad, so glad you're mine"
radiohead,The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
radiohead,"But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo"
radiohead,Did your string come undone
radiohead,You do it to yourself
radiohead,Dead from the neck up
radiohead,"Not my problem, give me some"
radiohead,"Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat"
radiohead,Do not cry out or hit the alarm
radiohead,You really messed up everything
radiohead,"Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads"
radiohead,You really messed up this time (ah)
radiohead,Pour yourself a hot bath
radiohead,I want you to notice
radiohead,"That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can"
radiohead,She lives with a broken man
radiohead,What am I coming to?
radiohead,Just sit back and listen
radiohead,That she bought from a rubber man
radiohead,I wanna a perfect body
radiohead,Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
radiohead,So now I set you free
radiohead,I think I have had my fill
radiohead,Where the weeds take root
radiohead,"Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel"
radiohead,What's the point of instruments
radiohead,Where the weeds take root
radiohead,"When I am king, you will be first against the wall"
radiohead,We are helpless to resist
radiohead,I can feel their blue hands touching me
radiohead,What the hell am I doing here?
radiohead,Have they all got the bends?
radiohead,And if I'm gonna talk
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,"Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall"
radiohead,"So cold, from the inside out"
radiohead,Just as you write my number down
radiohead,"I'm a fish now, out of water"
radiohead,Of all these weird creatures
radiohead,"If you think this is over, then you're wrong"
radiohead,You can try the best you can
radiohead,It's what you feel now
radiohead,The one who broke the spell
radiohead,If I did not have you?
radiohead,But he calls me up
radiohead,This is a low flying panic attack
radiohead,What if I just flip-flop?
radiohead,In a tight little world
radiohead,"I am such a tease, and you're such a flirt"
radiohead,Forget about your house of cards
radiohead,And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
radiohead,You run to the back and you cover your ears
radiohead,You do it to yourself
radiohead,They will suck you down
radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,When you mess with us
radiohead,A moon full of stars and astral cars
radiohead,And all you have to do is say yeah
radiohead,If you try the best you can
radiohead,This dread still covers us
radiohead,There'll be no more lies
radiohead,No alarms and no surprises
radiohead,"You're either in the club, baby, or you're not"
radiohead,Everything all of the time
radiohead,it's like i've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
radiohead,I did it for a reason
radiohead,Your skin makes me cry
radiohead,Falling asleep against the windowpane
radiohead,And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
radiohead,Are you such a dreamer
radiohead,And it wears me out
radiohead,A handshake of carbon monoxide
radiohead,"Been thinking about you, your records are here"
radiohead,Women and children first and the children first and the children
radiohead,"I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready."
radiohead,I can watch and not take part
radiohead,It is now the witching hour
radiohead,If I just turn and run
radiohead,"Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole"
radiohead,I follow to the edge of the earth
radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,I jumped into the river
radiohead,Gather up the lost and sold (don't hurt me)
radiohead,The words are coming out all weird
radiohead,Where you can't smell a thing
radiohead,No matter how it starts
radiohead,just to see what if
radiohead,And there'll be no more lies
radiohead,Won't take my eyes off the ball again
radiohead,"Don't reach out, don't reach out)"
radiohead,"So glad, so glad you're mine"
radiohead,Sit in the back while no-one drives
radiohead,With no alarms and no surprises
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,No matter what happens now
radiohead,To be trapped in your full stop
radiohead,When I'm playing with myself?
radiohead,This place is on a mission
radiohead,I feel my luck could change
radiohead,The wind rushing round my open heart
radiohead,"Out of sight and out of mind, lonely"
radiohead,You can try the best you can
radiohead,The only truth that I can see
radiohead,Did the cat get your tongue
radiohead,Immerse your soul in love
radiohead,"We know what you want,"
radiohead,But we all like stars
radiohead,Stepford wives who are we to complain?
radiohead,Let down and hanging around
radiohead,You've got a light you can feel it on your back
radiohead,It's what you feel now
radiohead,Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
radiohead,Why should I be good if you're not?
radiohead,And fade out again and fade out
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,"Yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you"
radiohead,I don't care if it hurts
radiohead,And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
radiohead,"She looks back, you look back"
radiohead,Where I end and you begin
radiohead,Like a house falling in the sea
radiohead,Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
radiohead,A spectre of my mortal soul
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,I could blow through the ceiling
radiohead,Genie let out the bottle
radiohead,Don't question my authority or put me in the box
radiohead,"Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles"
radiohead,Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
radiohead,To hide all the dirt and pain
radiohead,I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
radiohead,"We know what you want,"
radiohead,You know we're friends till we die
radiohead,I am up in the clouds
radiohead,You do it to yourself
radiohead,Just to see what is
radiohead,"Now we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people"
radiohead,We thought you had it in you
radiohead,That there's a way out
radiohead,"I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down"
radiohead,So lock the kids up safe tonight
radiohead,You do it to yourself
radiohead,"Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads"
radiohead,And now I'll set you free
radiohead,Just to fill your fast ballooning head
radiohead,Ice age coming ice age coming
radiohead,Like the parting of the waves
radiohead,Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
radiohead,Rules and wisdom choke you
radiohead,You are all I need
radiohead,"Just think of all the fun,"
radiohead,Little by little by hook or by crook
radiohead,It's always better on the outside
radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,He's like a detuned radio
radiohead,It holds us like a phantom
radiohead,But now I see you messing me around
radiohead,He used to do surgery
radiohead,You think you drive me crazy
radiohead,You really messed up this time (ah)
radiohead,Trying to get yourself away.
radiohead,"It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh"
radiohead,"What do you care when the other men are far, far better?"
radiohead,The amazing sound of the killing hordes
radiohead,Smacks you in the head
radiohead,It's gonna be a glorious day
radiohead,Dance you fucker dance you fucker
radiohead,"Off with his head, man"
radiohead,But we're still on the payroll
radiohead,Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
radiohead,Pull me out of the aircrash
radiohead,Before you run away from me
radiohead,And sailed on shooting stars
radiohead,If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
radiohead,Come back and focus again
radiohead,If you try the best you can
radiohead,"Go up to the mic,"
radiohead,"Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in"
radiohead,This is what you'll get
radiohead,"You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself"
radiohead,When you were here before
radiohead,For the folks back home
radiohead,You gotta be kidding me
radiohead,Futures tricked by the past
radiohead,Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
radiohead,Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
radiohead,"The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?"
radiohead,What do you care when I'm not there?
radiohead,They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
radiohead,Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
radiohead,You're turning into something you are not
radiohead,"Rows of houses, all bearing down on me"
radiohead,"Honey, come to me before it's too late"
radiohead,I wish I was special
radiohead,That there's a way out
radiohead,Just as the drinks arrive
radiohead,Oh hail to the thief
radiohead,And there'll be no more lies
radiohead,You are not to blame for
radiohead,Well what am I to do?
radiohead,You're just like an angel
radiohead,But the music's all wrong
radiohead,What the hell am I doing here?
radiohead,In your arms (don't hurt me)
radiohead,I just pretended that I had
radiohead,"Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed"
radiohead,Forget about your house of cards
radiohead,It's what keeps me alive
radiohead,Broken hearts make it rain
radiohead,"Yeah you, you know what I mean"
radiohead,"The bangers in the mash, the negatives for cash"
radiohead,If you had another name
radiohead,I will eat you alive
radiohead,Everyone has got the fear
radiohead,Kicks you in the teeth
radiohead,This is how I end up sucked in
radiohead,"I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy"
radiohead,"Well, come and break the door down"
radiohead,The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
radiohead,I'm talking to you after it's too late
radiohead,Before you take my mic
radiohead,If you take me there you'll get relief
radiohead,It's the devil's way now
radiohead,"But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo"
radiohead,The pillar of my soul
radiohead,Is you do it to yourself just you
radiohead,It comes to us all
