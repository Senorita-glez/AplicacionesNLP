adele,"Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you"

adele,"Reaching a fever pitch And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinking that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
adele,I can't help feeling We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep

adele,"They say that time's supposed to heal ya But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free"
adele,I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For everything that I've done But when I call you never Seem to be home Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried
adele,"To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?"
adele,"It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret"
adele,That the both of us Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side) I must've called a thousand times (thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry
adele,For everything that I've done But when I call you never Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
adele,"To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore"
adele,Anymore Hello from the other side (other side) I must've called a thousand times (thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry For everything that I've done
adele,But when I call you never Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry
adele,"For breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word"
adele,"They've all been said before you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what's coming next Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong"
adele,I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use
adele,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty It's already in your eyes
adele,"And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one that matters Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong"
adele,I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use
adele,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us
adele,I don't wanna be cruel or vicious And I ain't asking for forgiveness All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
adele,"Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,"
adele,"And as it fell you rose to claim it It was dark and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong But my knees were far too weak"
adele,"To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,"Watched it pour as I touched your face Let it burn while I cry 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you I could stay there, close my eyes"
adele,"Feel you here, forever You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
adele,"Watched it pour as I touched your face Let it burn while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames"
adele,"Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you Even now when it's already over"
adele,"I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Let it burn while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain"
adele,"And I threw us into the flames Where I felt something die 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh Oh, oh Let it burn, oh"
adele,Let it burn Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk To the way you move
adele,Everybody here is watching you 'Cause you feel like home You're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone
adele,Can I have a moment Before I go? 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
adele,"You sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time"
adele,That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless
adele,It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Nobody told me that you'd be here And I swore you moved overseas
adele,"That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie You still sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light"
adele,In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old
adele,It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young When we were young
adele,When we were young When we were young It's hard to win me back Everything just takes me back To when you were there
adele,To when you were there And a part of me keeps holding on Just in case it hasn't gone I guess I still care
adele,"Do you still care? It was just like a movie It was just like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young When we were young"
adele,When we were young When we were young When we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time
adele,That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless
adele,"Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old It makes me reckless It was just like a movie It was just like a song"
adele,When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you
adele,Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am free again Whenever I'm alone with you
adele,You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you However far away I will always love you
adele,However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you
adele,'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
adele,And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong
adele,"I've known it from the moment that we met no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawling down the avenue No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do"
adele,"To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true"
adele,Nothing that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of the Earth for you To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind Don't need to think it over
adele,If I'm wrong I am right Don't need to look no further This ain't lust I know this is love but If I tell the world
adele,I'll never say enough Cause it was not said to you And that's exactly what I need to do If I'm in love with you Should I give up
adele,Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste? Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
adele,Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up And fly around in circles
adele,Waiting as my heart drops And my back begins to tingle Finally could this be it or Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste? Even if I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up
adele,"Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if, it leads nowhere"
adele,"Or would it be a waste? Even if I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up, Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?"
adele,Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste?
adele,Even if I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
adele,"You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said No final kiss to seal anything I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
adele,"But don't you remember, don't you remember? The reason you loved me before, Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me? Or have you completely erased me from your memories?"
adele,"I often think about where I went wrong The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,"The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe I kept my distance so you would be free In hope that you find the missing piece"
adele,"To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember? The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more When will I see you again? She, she ain't real"
adele,She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will She is a stranger You and I have history Or don't you remember
adele,"Sure, she's got it all But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds You made a fool out of you And, boy, she's bringing you down"
adele,"She made your heart melt But you're cold to the core Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh"
adele,"Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh"
adele,"Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed I heard you've been missing me"
adele,"You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be Like when we creep out and she ain't around Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds You made a fool out of me"
adele,"And, boy, you're bringing me down You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh"
adele,"Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh"
adele,"Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh All of these words whispered in my ear Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it"
adele,"People say crazy things Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh, Rumor has it, ooh,"

adele,I grow fonder every day Lose myself in time Just thinking of your face God only knows why it's taken me
adele,"So long to let my doubts go You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared I've been here before Every feeling, every word"
adele,"I've imagined it all You'll never know if you never try To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only I promise I'm worthy"
adele,To hold in your arms So come on and give me the chance To prove I am the one who can walk that mile Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
adele,You hang on every word I say Lose yourself in time At the mention of my name Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
adele,"And have you tell me Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared 'Cause I've been here before Every feeling, every word"
adele,"I've imagined it all You'll never know if you never try To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only I promise I'm worthy, mm"
adele,To hold in your arms So come on and give me the chance To prove I am the one who can walk that mile Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
adele,I know it ain't easy giving up your heart (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart) Trust me I've learned it (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
adele,Trust me I've learned it (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart) Trust me I've learned it (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)

adele,"To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile Until the end starts If you're not the one for me"
adele,Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees If you're not the one for me Why do I hate the idea of being free? And if I'm not the one for you
adele,You've gotta stop holding me the way you do Oh when you found that the one for you Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness I want you to be my keeper
adele,"But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently Don't pretend that you don't want me Our love ain't water under the bridge If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
adele,Don't pretend that you don't want me Our love ain't water under the bridge Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for? You never seem to make it through the door
adele,"And who are you hiding from? It ain't no life to live like you're on the run Have I ever asked for much? The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
adele,"Don't pretend that you don't want me Our love ain't water under the bridge If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently Don't pretend that you don't want me"

adele,"Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did Missing out the cracks in the pavement And turning my heel and strutting my feet ""Is there anything I can do for you dear?"
adele,"Is there anyone I could call?"" ""No and thank you, please Madam. I ain't lost, just wandering"" Round my hometown Memories are fresh"

adele,"I can't give you what you think you gave me It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see Where love is lost, your ghost is found I've braved a hundred storms to leave you"
adele,"As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no I won't ask you, you to just desert me I can't give you what you think you gave me"
adele,"It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior When the thunder calls to me Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no"
adele,"I won't ask you, you to just desert me I can't give you what you think you gave me It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end"
adele,Hold your breath and count to ten Feel the earth move and then Hear my heart burst again For this is the end I've drowned and dreamt this moment
adele,"So overdue I owe them Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall"
adele,Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together
adele,"At skyfall Skyfall is where we start A thousand miles and poles apart Where worlds collide and days are dark You may have my number, you can take my name"
adele,But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall
adele,When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At skyfall Where you go I go
adele,What you see I see I know I'd never be me Without the security Of your loving arms
adele,Keeping me from harm Put your hand in my hand And we'll stand Let the sky fall When it crumbles
adele,We will stand tall Face it all together Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall

Alexander Hamilton The issue on the table: a petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms. This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin, it cannot go ignored. If this comes to a vote in Congress, what is the White House's position? Secretary Jefferson, you first. Tread lightly... Sir The constitution clearly states"
lin-manuel-miranda,"That the states have to wait Until eighteen-oh-eight to debate On whether to end the slave trade And whether or not you want it, guys"
lin-manuel-miranda,"That is the final compromise we made Sir wait- But for a second let us say that we can legislate Unanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great We cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate So back to Africa or do they get a separate state?"
lin-manuel-miranda,"In 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West My notion didn't get a single vote Slavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer But we can't address the question if we do not have an answer Is it my turn? Good"

lin-manuel-miranda,"How will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses? How dare you Yet still, people follow like lemmings All your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings That's enough Well you asked how I feel I don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real If I may, Mr. President? Let's take this moment to establish a precedent"
lin-manuel-miranda,"First of all, sir, we won't involve you in this Imagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous I'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year That was agreed upon"
lin-manuel-miranda,"That buys us time and assuages fear I'll tell the North that on January 1st Of that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst Once I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen"
lin-manuel-miranda,"And introduce a notion never to discuss this again Mr President!
