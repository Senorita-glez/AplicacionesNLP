I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you two Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
adele,"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you two Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you two Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark Finally I can see you crystal clear [Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare [Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare See how I leave with every piece of you"
adele,"Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinking that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me) And you played it, to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told But I've heard one on you And I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Make a home down there As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us"
adele,"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me) And you played it, to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah) Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah) Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)"
adele,"You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah) (You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could have had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me) And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it"
adele,"You played it You played it You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you I'm sorry For everything that I've done But when I call you never Seem to be home Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly"
adele,"Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret That the both of us Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side) I must've called a thousand times (thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry For everything that I've done But when I call you never Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore Oh, anymore Oh, anymore Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)"
adele,"I must've called a thousand times (thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry For everything that I've done But when I call you never Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said before you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what's coming next Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do"
adele,"It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty It's already in your eyes And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since you're the only one that matters Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I don't wanna be cruel or vicious And I ain't asking for forgiveness All I ask is If this is my last night with you Hold me like I'm more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use"
adele,"Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart, And as it fell you rose to claim it It was dark and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong But my knees were far too weak To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Let it burn while I cry 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you I could stay there, close my eyes Feel you here, forever You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face"
adele,"Let it burn while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you Even now when it's already over I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Let it burn while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames Where I felt something die 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh Oh, oh Let it burn, oh Let it burn Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk To the way you move Everybody here is watching you"
adele,"'Cause you feel like home You're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment Before I go? 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie You sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Nobody told me that you'd be here And I swore you moved overseas That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie"
adele,"You still sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young When we were young When we were young When we were young It's hard to win me back Everything just takes me back To when you were there To when you were there And a part of me keeps holding on Just in case it hasn't gone I guess I still care Do you still care? It was just like a movie"
adele,"It was just like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young When we were young When we were young When we were young When we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized We were sad of getting old It made us restless Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old It makes me reckless It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again"
adele,Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am free again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you 'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears
adele,"I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong I've known it from the moment that we met no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawling down the avenue No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true Nothing that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of the Earth for you To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind Don't need to think it over If I'm wrong I am right Don't need to look no further This ain't lust I know this is love but If I tell the world I'll never say enough"
adele,Cause it was not said to you And that's exactly what I need to do If I'm in love with you Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste? Even If I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up And fly around in circles Waiting as my heart drops And my back begins to tingle Finally could this be it or Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste? Even if I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
adele,"Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if, it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste? Even if I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up, Or should I just keep on chasing pavements? Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere Or would it be a waste? Even if I knew my place should I leave it there? Should I give up Or should I just keep chasing pavements? Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again? You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said No final kiss to seal anything I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
adele,"The reason you loved me before, Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me? Or have you completely erased me from your memories? I often think about where I went wrong The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head But don't you remember, don't you remember? The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe I kept my distance so you would be free In hope that you find the missing piece To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember? The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more When will I see you again? She, she ain't real She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will She is a stranger You and I have history Or don't you remember Sure, she's got it all"
adele,"But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds You made a fool out of you And, boy, she's bringing you down She made your heart melt But you're cold to the core Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed I heard you've been missing me You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be Like when we creep out and she ain't around Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds You made a fool out of me And, boy, you're bringing me down"

adele,"So come on and give me the chance To prove I am the one who can walk that mile Until the end starts If I've been on your mind You hang on every word I say Lose yourself in time At the mention of my name Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close And have you tell me Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared 'Cause I've been here before Every feeling, every word I've imagined it all You'll never know if you never try To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only I promise I'm worthy, mm To hold in your arms So come on and give me the chance To prove I am the one who can walk that mile Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart I know it ain't easy giving up your heart"

adele,"If you're not the one for me Why do I hate the idea of being free? And if I'm not the one for you You've gotta stop holding me the way you do Oh when you found that the one for you Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness I want you to be my keeper But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently Don't pretend that you don't want me Our love ain't water under the bridge If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently Don't pretend that you don't want me Our love ain't water under the bridge Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for? You never seem to make it through the door And who are you hiding from? It ain't no life to live like you're on the run Have I ever asked for much? The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently Don't pretend that you don't want me"

lin-manuel-miranda,"The world will never be the same, oh The ship is in the harbor now See if you can spot him Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom His enemies destroyed his rep America forgot him We fought with him Me, I died for him Me, I trusted him Me, I loved him And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him There's a million things I haven't done But just you wait What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton The issue on the table: a petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms. This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin, it cannot go ignored. If this comes to a vote in Congress, what is the White House's position? Secretary Jefferson, you first. Tread lightly... Sir The constitution clearly states That the states have to wait Until eighteen-oh-eight to debate On whether to end the slave trade And whether or not you want it, guys That is the final compromise we made Sir wait- But for a second let us say that we can legislate Unanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great We cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate So back to Africa or do they get a separate state? In 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West My notion didn't get a single vote Slavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer But we can't address the question if we do not have an answer Is it my turn? Good Plantation states are packed with promise makers Do you realize the precious time these legislators wasted? Institutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles Wait till the 1800's, and their population doubles"
lin-manuel-miranda,"You all know This is the stain on our soul and democracy A land of the free? No, it's not, it's hypocrisy To subjugate, dehumanize a race, call 'em property And say that we are powerless to stop it, can you not foresee? Sir, even you, you have hundreds of slaves Whose descendants will curse our names when we're safe in our graves How will the south find labor for its businesses? How will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses? How dare you Yet still, people follow like lemmings All your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings That's enough Well you asked how I feel I don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real If I may, Mr. President? Madison? Let's take this moment to establish a precedent First of all, sir, we won't involve you in this Imagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous I'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year That was agreed upon That buys us time and assuages fear I'll tell the North that on January 1st Of that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst"
lin-manuel-miranda,"Once I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen And introduce a notion never to discuss this again Mr President! Hamilton, if we support emancipation Every single slave owner will demand compensation And as for slandering Jefferson with talk of mistresses Do you really wanna- Do you really wanna have that conversation? No Madison, execute your plan to the letter Let's hope the next generation thinks of something better I saved every letter you wrote me From the moment I read them, I knew you were mine You said you were mine I thought you were mine Do you know what Angelica said When we saw your first letter arrive? She said ""Be careful with that one, love He will do what it takes to survive"" You and your words flooded my senses Your sentences left me defenseless You built me palaces out of paragraphs You built cathedrals I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me I'm searching and scanning for answers in every line For some kind of sign, and when you were mine The world seemed to burn Burn You published the letters she wrote you"
lin-manuel-miranda,"You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives Do you know what Angelica said When she read what you'd done? She said ""You have married an Icarus He has flown too close to the sun"" You and your words, obsessed with your legacy Your sentences border on senseless And you are paranoid in every paragraph How they perceive you You, you, you I'm erasing myself from the narrative Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart You have torn it all apart, I'm watching it Burn Watching it burn The world has no right to my heart The world has no place in our bed They don't get to know what I said I'm burning the memories Burning the letters that might have redeemed you You forfeit all rights to my heart"
lin-manuel-miranda,You forfeit the place in our bed You sleep in your office instead With only the memories of when you were mine I hope that you burn
